THE <i>PHAEDRUS</i> AND THE NATURE OF RHETORIC</h2>

</div>

<p>Our subject begins with the threshold difficulty of defining
the question which Plato’s <i>Phaedrus</i> was meant
to answer. Students of this justly celebrated dialogue
have felt uncertain of its unity of theme, and the tendency has
been to designate it broadly as a discussion of the ethical and
the beautiful. The explicit topics of the dialogue are, in order:
love, the soul, speechmaking, and the spoken and written
word, or what is generally termed by us “composition.” The
development looks random, and some of the most interesting
passages appear <i>jeux d’esprit</i>. The richness of the literary art
diverts attention from the substance of the argument.</p>

<p>But a work of art which touches on many profound problems
justifies more than one kind of reading. Our difficulty
with the <i>Phaedrus</i> may be that our interpretation has been too
literal and too topical. If we will bring to the reading of it even
a portion of that imagination which Plato habitually exercised,
we should perceive surely enough that it is consistently, and
from beginning to end, about one thing, which is the nature
of rhetoric.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Again, that point may have been missed because
most readers conceive rhetoric to be a system of artifice rather
than an idea,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the <i>Phaedrus</i>, for all its apparent divagation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
keeps very close to a single idea. A study of its rhetorical structure,
especially, may give us the insight which has been withheld,
while making us feel anew that Plato possessed the
deepest divining rod among the ancients.</p>

<p>For the imaginative interpretation which we shall now
undertake, we have both general and specific warrant. First, it
scarcely needs pointing out that a Socratic dialogue is in itself
an example of transcendence. Beginning with something
simple and topical, it passes to more general levels of application;
and not infrequently, it must make the leap into allegory
for the final utterance. This means, of course, that a Socratic
dialogue may be about its subject implicitly as well as explicitly.
The implicit rendering is usually through some kind
of figuration because it is the nature of this meaning to be
ineffable in any other way. It is necessary, therefore, to be
alert for what takes place through the analogical mode.</p>

<p>Second, it is a matter of curious interest that a warning
against literal reading occurs at an early stage of the <i>Phaedrus</i>.
Here in the opening pages, appearing as if to set the key of the
theme, comes an allusion to the myth of Boreas and Oreithyia.
On the very spot where the dialogue begins, Boreas is said to
have carried off the maiden. Does Socrates believe that this
tale is really true? Or is he in favor of a scientific explanation
of what the myth alleges? Athens had scientific experts, and
the scientific explanation was that the north wind had pushed
her off some rocks where she was playing with a companion.
In this way the poetical story is provided with a factual basis.
The answer of Socrates is that many tales are open to this kind
of rationalization, but that the result is tedious and actually
irrelevant. It is irrelevant because our chief concern is with
the nature of the man, and it is beside the point to probe into
such matters while we are yet ignorant of ourselves. The scientific
criticism of Greek mythology, which may be likened to
the scientific criticism of the myths of the Bible in our own
day, produces at best “a boorish sort of wisdom (ἀγροίκῳ τινὶ
σοφίᾳ).” It is a limitation to suppose that the truth of the story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
lies in its historicity. The “boorish sort of wisdom” seeks to
supplant poetic allegation with fact, just as an archaeologist
might look for the foundations of the Garden of Eden. But
while this sort of search goes on the truth flies off, on wings of
imagination, and is not recoverable until the searcher attains a
higher level of pursuit. Socrates is satisfied with the parable,
and we infer from numerous other passages that he believed
that some things are best told by parable and some perhaps
discoverable only by parable. Real investigation goes forward
with the help of analogy. “Freud without Sophocles is unthinkable,”
a modern writer has said.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>With these precepts in mind, we turn to that part of the
<i>Phaedrus</i> which has proved most puzzling: why is so much
said about the absurd relationship of the lover and the non-lover?
Socrates encounters Phaedrus outside the city wall. The
latter has just come from hearing a discourse by Lysias which
enchanted him with its eloquence. He is prevailed upon to
repeat this discourse, and the two seek out a shady spot on
the banks of the Ilissus. Now the discourse is remarkable because
although it was “in a way, a love speech,” its argument
was that people should grant favors to non-lovers rather than
to lovers. “This is just the clever thing about it,” Phaedrus
remarks. People are in the habit of preferring their lovers, but
it is much more intelligent, as the argument of Lysias runs, to
prefer a non-lover. Accordingly, the first major topic of the
dialogue is a eulogy of the non-lover. The speech provides
good subject matter for jesting on the part of Socrates, and
looks like another exhibition of the childlike ingeniousness
which gives the Greeks their charm. Is it merely a piece of
literary trifling? Rather, it is Plato’s dramatistic presentation
of a major thesis. Beneath the surface of repartee and mock
seriousness, he is asking whether we ought to prefer a neuter
form of speech to the kind which is ever getting us aroused
over things and provoking an expense of spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Sophistications of theory cannot obscure the truth that there
are but three ways for language to affect us. It can move us
toward what is good; it can move us toward what is evil; or it
can, in hypothetical third place, fail to move us at all.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Of
course there are numberless degrees of effect under the first
two heads, and the third, as will be shown, is an approximate
rather than an absolute zero of effect. But any utterance is a
major assumption of responsibility, and the assumption that
one can avoid that responsibility by doing something to language
itself is one of the chief considerations of the <i>Phaedrus</i>,
just as it is of contemporary semantic theory. What Plato has
succeeded in doing in this dialogue, whether by a remarkably
effaced design, or unconsciously through the formal pressure
of his conception, is to give us embodiments of the three types
of discourse. These are respectively the non-lover, the evil
lover, and the noble lover. We shall take up these figures in
their sequence and show their relevance to the problem of
language.</p>

<p>The eulogy of the non-lover in the speech of Lysias, as we
hear it repeated to Socrates, stresses the fact that the non-lover
follows a policy of enlightened self-interest. First of all,
the non-lover does not neglect his affairs or commit extreme
acts under the influence of passion. Since he acts from calculation,
he never has occasion for remorse. No one ever says of
him that he is not in his right mind, because all of his acts are
within prudential bounds. The first point is, in sum, that the
non-lover never sacrifices himself and therefore never feels
the vexation which overtakes lovers when they recover from
their passion and try to balance their pains with their profit.
And the non-lover is constant whereas the lover is inconstant.
The first argument then is that the non-lover demonstrates his
superiority through prudence and objectivity. The second
point of superiority found in non-lovers is that there are many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
more of them. If one is limited in one’s choice to one’s lovers,
the range is small; but as there are always more non-lovers
than lovers, one has a better chance in choosing among many
of finding something worthy of one’s affection. A third point
of superiority is that association with the non-lover does not
excite public comment. If one is seen going about with the
object of one’s love, one is likely to provoke gossip; but when
one is seen conversing with the non-lover, people merely realize
that “everybody must converse with somebody.” Therefore
this kind of relationship does not affect one’s public standing,
and one is not disturbed by what the neighbors are saying.
Finally, non-lovers are not jealous of one’s associates. Accordingly
they do not try to keep one from companions of intellect
or wealth for fear that they may be outshone themselves. The
lover, by contrast, tries to draw his beloved away from such
companionship and so deprives him of improving associations.
The argument is concluded with a generalization that one
ought to grant favors not to the needy or the importunate, but
to those who are able to repay. Such is the favorable account
of the non-lover given by Lysias.</p>

<p>We must now observe how these points of superiority correspond
to those of “semantically purified” speech. By “semantically
purified speech” we mean the kind of speech approaching
pure notation in the respect that it communicates
abstract intelligence without impulsion. It is a simple instrumentality,
showing no affection for the object of its symbolizing
and incapable of inducing bias in the hearer. In its ideal
conception, it would have less power to move than 2 + 2 = 4,
since it is generally admitted that mathematical equations
may have the beauty of elegance, and hence are not above
suspicion where beauty is suspect. But this neuter language
will be an unqualified medium of transmission of meanings
from mind to mind, and by virtue of its minds can remain in
an unprejudiced relationship to the world and also to other
minds.</p>

<p>Since the characteristic of this language is absence of anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
like affection, it exhibits toward the thing being represented
merely a sober fidelity, like that of the non-lover toward
his companion. Instead of passion, it offers the serviceability
of objectivity. Its “enlightened self-interest” takes the
form of an unvarying accuracy and regularity in its symbolic
references, most, if not all of which will be to verifiable data in
the extramental world. Like a thrifty burgher, it has no romanticism
about it; and it distrusts any departure from the
literal and prosaic. The burgher has his feet on the ground;
and similarly the language of pure notation has its point-by-point
contact with objective reality. As Stuart Chase, one of its
modern proponents, says in <i>The Tyranny of Words</i>: “<i>If we
wish to understand the world and ourselves, it follows that we
should use a language whose structure corresponds to physical
structure</i>”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (italics his). So this language is married to the
world, and its marital fidelity contrasts with the extravagances
of other languages.</p>

<p>In second place, this language is far more “available.”
Whereas rhetorical language, or language which would persuade,
must always be particularized to suit the occasion,
drawing its effectiveness from many small nuances, a “utility”
language is very general and one has no difficulty putting his
meaning into it if he is satisfied with a paraphrase of that
meaning. The 850 words recommended for Basic English, for
example, are highly available in the sense that all native users
of English have them instantly ready and learners of English
can quickly acquire them. It soon becomes apparent, however,
that the availability is a heavy tax upon all other qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Most of what we admire as energy and fullness tends to disappear
when mere verbal counters are used. The conventional
or public aspect of language can encroach upon the suggestive
or symbolical aspect, until the naming is vague or blurred.
In proportion as the medium is conventional in the widest
sense and avoids all individualizing, personalizing, and heightening
terms, it is common, and the commonness constitutes
the negative virtue ascribed to the non-lover.</p>

<p>Finally, with reference to the third qualification of the non-lover,
it is true that neuter language does not excite public
opinion. This fact follows from its character outlined above.
Rhetorical language on the other hand, for whatever purpose
used, excites interest and with it either pleasure or alarm.
People listen instinctively to the man whose speech betrays
inclination. It does not matter what the inclination is toward,
but we may say that the greater the degree of inclination, the
greater the curiosity or response. Hence a “style” in speech
always causes one to be a marked man, and the public may not
be so much impressed—at least initially—by what the man is
for or against as by the fact that he has a style. The way therefore
to avoid public comment is to avoid the speech of affection
and to use that of business, since, to echo the original proposition
of Lysias, everybody knows that one must do business
with others. From another standpoint, then, this is the language
of prudence. These are the features which give neuter
discourse an appeal to those who expect a scientific solution
of human problems.</p>

<p>In summing up the trend of meaning, we note that Lysias
has been praising a disinterested kind of relationship which
avoids all excesses and irrationalities, all the dementia of love.
It is a circumspect kind of relationship, which is preferred by
all men who wish to do well in the world and avoid tempestuous
courses. We have compared its detachment with the kind
of abstraction to be found in scientific notation. But as an
earnest of what is to come let us note, in taking leave of this
part, that Phaedrus expresses admiration for the eloquence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
especially of diction, with which the suit of the non-lover has
been urged. This is our warning of the dilemma of the non-lover.</p>

<p>Now we turn to the second major speech of the dialogue,
which is made by Socrates. Notwithstanding Phaedrus’ enthusiastic
praise, Socrates is dissatisfied with the speech of the
non-lover. He remembers having heard wiser things on the
subject and feels that he can make a speech on the same theme
“different from this and quite as good.” After some playful
exchange, Socrates launches upon his own abuse of love, which
centers on the point that the lover is an exploiter. Love (ἔρως)
is defined as the kind of desire which overcomes rational opinion
and moves toward the enjoyment of personal or bodily
beauty. The lover wishes to make the object of his passion as
pleasing to himself as possible; but to those possessed by this
frenzy, only that which is subject to their will is pleasant. Accordingly,
everything which is opposed, or is equal or better,
the lover views with hostility. He naturally therefore tries to
make the beloved inferior to himself in every respect. He is
pleased if the beloved has intellectual limitations because they
have the effect of making him manageable. For a similar reason
he tries to keep him away from all influences which might
“make a man of him,” and of course the greatest of these is
divine philosophy. While he is working to keep him intellectually
immature, he works also to keep him weak and effeminate,
with such harmful result that the beloved is unable to
play a man’s part in crises. The lover is, moreover, jealous of
the possession of property because this gives the beloved an
independence which he does not wish him to have. Thus the
lover in exercising an unremitting compulsion over the beloved
deprives him of all praiseworthy qualities, and this is the
price the beloved pays for accepting a lover who is “necessarily
without reason.” In brief, the lover is not motivated by
benevolence toward the beloved, but by selfish appetite; and
Socrates can aptly close with the quotation: “As wolves love
lambs, so lovers love their loves.” The speech is on the single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
theme of exploitation. It is important for us to keep in mind
the object of love as here described, because another kind of
love with a different object is later introduced into the dialogue,
and we shall discuss the counterpart of each.</p>

<p>As we look now for the parallel in language, we find ourselves
confronting the second of the three alternatives: speech
which influences us in the direction of what is evil. This we
shall call base rhetoric because its end is the exploitation which
Socrates has been condemning. We find that base rhetoric
hates that which is opposed, or is equal or better because all
such things are impediments to its will, and in the last analysis
it knows only its will. Truth is the stubborn, objective restraint
which this will endeavors to overcome. Base rhetoric is therefore
always trying to keep its objects from the support which
personal courage, noble associations, and divine philosophy
provide a man.</p>

<p>The base rhetorician, we may say, is a man who has yielded
to the wrong aspects of existence. He has allowed himself to
succumb to the sights and shows, to the physical pleasures
which conspire against noble life. He knows that the only way
he can get a following in his pursuits (and a following seems
necessary to maximum enjoyment of the pursuits) is to work
against the true understanding of his followers. Consequently
the things which would elevate he keeps out of sight, and the
things with which he surrounds his “beloved” are those which
minister immediately to desire. The beloved is thus emasculated
in understanding in order that the lover may have his
way. Or as Socrates expresses it, the selfish lover contrives
things so that the beloved will be “most agreeable to him and
most harmful to himself.”</p>

<p>Examples of this kind of contrivance occur on every hand
in the impassioned language of journalism and political pleading.
In the world of affairs which these seek to influence, the
many are kept in a state of pupillage so that they will be most
docile to their “lovers.” The techniques of the base lover, especially
as exemplified in modern journalism, would make a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
catalogue, but in general it is accurate to say that he seeks to
keep the understanding in a passive state by never permitting
an honest examination of alternatives. Nothing is more feared
by him than a true dialectic, for this not only endangers his
favored alternative, but also gives the “beloved”—how clearly
here are these the “lambs” of Socrates’ figure—some training
in intellectual independence. What he does therefore is dress
up one alternative in all the cheap finery of immediate hopes
and fears, knowing that if he can thus prevent a masculine
exercise of imagination and will, he can have his way. By discussing
only one side of an issue, by mentioning cause without
consequence or consequence without cause, acts without
agents or agents without agency,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he often successfully blocks
definition and cause-and-effect reasoning. In this way his
choices are arrayed in such meretricious images that one can
quickly infer the juvenile mind which they would attract. Of
course the base rhetorician today, with his vastly augmented
power of propagation, has means of deluding which no ancient
rhetor in forum or market place could have imagined.</p>

<p>Because Socrates has now made a speech against love, representing
it as an evil, the non-lover seems to survive in estimation.
We observe, however, that the non-lover, instead of
being celebrated, is disposed of dialectically. “So, in a word,
I say that the non-lover possesses all the advantages that are
opposed to the disadvantages we found in the lover.” This is
not without bearing upon the subject matter of the important
third speech, to which we now turn.</p>

<p>At this point in the dialogue, Socrates is warned by his
monitory spirit that he has been engaging in a defamation of
love despite the fact that love is a divinity. “If love is, as indeed
he is, a god or something divine, he can be nothing evil; but
the two speeches just now said that he was evil.” These discourses
were then an impiety—one representing non-love as
admirable and the other attacking love as base. Socrates resolves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to make amends, and the recantation which follows is
one of the most elaborate developments in the Platonic system.
The account of love which emerges from this new position
may be summarized as follows.</p>

<p>Love is often censured as a form of madness, yet not all
madness is evil. There is a madness which is simple degeneracy,
but on the other hand there are kinds of madness which
are really forms of inspiration, from which come the greatest
gifts conferred on man. Prophecy is a kind of madness, and so
too is poetry. “The poetry of the sane man vanishes into nothingness
before that of the inspired madman.” Mere sanity,
which is of human origin, is inferior to that madness which is
inspired by the gods and which is a condition for the highest
kind of achievement. In this category goes the madness of the
true lover. His is a generous state which confers blessings to
the ignoring of self, whereas the conduct of the non-lover displays
all the selfishness of business: “the affection of the non-lover,
which is alloyed with mortal prudence and follows
mortal and parsimonious rules of conduct will beget in the
beloved soul the narrowness which common folk praise as
virtue; it will cause the soul to be a wanderer upon the earth
for nine thousand years and a fool below the earth at last.”
It is the vulgar who do not realize that the madness of the
noble lover is an inspired madness because he has his thoughts
turned toward a beauty of divine origin.</p>

<p>Now the attitude of the noble lover toward the beloved is
in direct contrast with that of the evil lover, who, as we have
seen, strives to possess and victimize the object of his affections.
For once the noble lover has mastered the conflict within
his own soul by conquering appetite and fixing his attention
upon the intelligible and the divine, he conceives an exalted
attitude toward the beloved. The noble lover now “follows
the beloved in reverence and awe.” So those who are filled
with this kind of love “exhibit no jealousy or meanness toward
the loved one, but endeavor by every means in their power to
lead him to the likeness of the god whom they honor.” Such is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the conversion by which love turns from the exploitative to
the creative.</p>

<p>Here it becomes necessary to bring our concepts together
and to think of all speech having persuasive power as a kind
of “love.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus, rhetorical speech is madness to the extent
that it departs from the line which mere sanity lays down.
There is always in its statement a kind of excess or deficiency
which is immediately discernible when the test of simple realism
is applied. Simple realism operates on a principle of equation
or correspondence; one thing must match another, or,
representation must tally with thing represented, like items in
a tradesman’s account. Any excess or deficiency on the part of
the representation invokes the existence of the world of symbolism,
which simple realism must deny. This explains why
there is an immortal feud between men of business and the
users of metaphor and metonymy, the poets and the rhetoricians.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The man of business, the narrow and parsimonious soul
in the allusion of Socrates, desires a world which is a reliable
materiality. But this the poet and rhetorician will never let
him have, for each, with his own purpose, is trying to advance
the borders of the imaginative world. A primrose by the river’s
brim will not remain that in the poet’s account, but is promptly
turned into something very much larger and something highly
implicative. He who is accustomed to record the world with
an abacus cannot follow these transfigurations; and indeed
the very occurrence of them subtly undermines the premise
of his business. It is the historic tendency of the tradesman,
therefore, to confine passion to quite narrow channels so that
it will not upset the decent business arrangements of the
world. But if the poet, as the chief transformer of our picture
of the world, is the peculiar enemy of this mentality, the rhetorician<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is also hostile when practicing the kind of love proper
to him. The “passion” in his speech is revolutionary, and it
has a practical end.</p>

<p>We have now indicated the significance of the three types
of lovers; but the remainder of the <i>Phaedrus</i> has much more
to say about the nature of rhetoric, and we must return to one
or more points to place our subject in a wider context. The
problem of rhetoric which occupied Plato persistently, not
only in the <i>Phaedrus</i> but also in other dialogues where this art
is reviewed, may be best stated as a question: if truth alone is
not sufficient to persuade men, what else remains that can be
legitimately added? In one of the exchanges with Phaedrus,
Socrates puts the question in the mouth of a personified Rhetoric:
“I do not compel anyone to learn to speak without knowing
the truth, but if my advice is of any value, he learns that
first and then acquires me. So what I claim is this, that without
my help the knowledge of the truth does not give the art of
persuasion.”</p>

<p>Now rhetoric as we have discussed it in relation to the lovers
consists of truth plus its artful presentation, and for this reason
it becomes necessary to say something more about the natural
order of dialectic and rhetoric. In any general characterization
rhetoric will include dialectic,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but for the study of method it
is necessary to separate the two. Dialectic is a method of investigation
whose object is the establishment of truth about
doubtful propositions. Aristotle in the <i>Topics</i> gives a concise
statement of its nature. “A dialectical problem is a subject of
inquiry that contributes either to choice or avoidance, or to
truth and knowledge, and that either by itself, or as a help to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the solution of some other such problem. It must, moreover,
be something on which either people hold no opinion either
way, or the masses hold a contrary opinion to the philosophers,
or the philosophers to the masses, or each of them among
themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Plato is not perfectly clear about the distinction
between positive and dialectical terms. In one passage<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he
contrasts the “positive” terms “iron” and “silver” with the “dialectical”
terms “justice” and “goodness”; yet in other passages
his “dialectical” terms seem to include categorizations of the
external world. Thus Socrates indicates that distinguishing
the horse from the ass is a dialectical operation;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and he tells
us later that a good dialectician is able to divide things by
classes “where the natural joints are” and will avoid breaking
any part “after the manner of a bad carver.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Such, perhaps, is
Aristotle’s dialectic which contributes to truth and knowledge.</p>

<p>But there is a branch of dialectic which contributes to
“choice or avoidance,” and it is with this that rhetoric is regularly
found joined. Generally speaking, this is a rhetoric involving
questions of policy, and the dialectic which precedes
it will determine not the application of positive terms but that
of terms which are subject to the contingency of evaluation.
Here dialectical inquiry will concern itself not with what is
“iron” but with what is “good.” It seeks to establish what belongs
in the category of the “just” rather than what belongs in
the genus <i>Canis</i>. As a general rule, simple object words such
as “iron” and “house” have no connotations of policy, although
it is frequently possible to give them these through speech
situations in which there is added to their referential function
a kind of impulse. We should have to interpret in this way
“Fire!” or “Gold!” because these terms acquire something
through intonation and relationship which places them in the
class of evaluative expressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>Any piece of persuasion, therefore, will contain as its first
process a dialectic establishing terms which have to do with
policy. Now a term of policy is essentially a term of motion,
and here begins the congruence of rhetoric with the soul
which underlies the speculation of the <i>Phaedrus</i>. In his myth
of the charioteer, Socrates declares that every soul is immortal
because “that which is ever moving is immortal.” Motion, it
would appear from this definition, is part of the soul’s essence.
And just because the soul is ever tending, positive or indifferent
terms cannot partake of this congruence. But terms of
tendency—goodness, justice, divinity, and the like—are terms
of motion and therefore may be said to comport with the soul’s
essence. The soul’s perception of goodness, justice, and divinity
will depend upon its proper tendency, while at the same
time contacts with these in discourse confirm and direct that
tendency. The education of the soul is not a process of bringing
it into correspondence with a physical structure like the
external world, but rather a process of rightly affecting its
motion. By this conception, a soul which is rightly affected
calls that good which is good; but a soul which is wrongly
turned calls that good which is evil. What Plato has prepared
us to see is that the virtuous rhetorician, who is a lover of
truth, has a soul of such movement that its dialectical perceptions
are consonant with those of a divine mind. Or, in the
language of more technical philosophy, this soul is aware of
axiological systems which have ontic status. The good soul,
consequently, will not urge a perversion of justice as justice in
order to impose upon the commonwealth. Insofar as the soul
has its impulse in the right direction, its definitions will agree
with the true nature of intelligible things.</p>

<p>There is, then, no true rhetoric without dialectic, for the
dialectic provides that basis of “high speculation about nature”
without which rhetoric in the narrower sense has nothing
to work upon. Yet, when the disputed terms have been
established, we are at the limit of dialectic. How does the
noble rhetorician proceed from this point on? That the clearest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
demonstration in terms of logical inclusion and exclusion
often fails to win assent we hardly need state; therefore, to
what does the rhetorician resort at this critical passage? It is
the stage at which he passes from the logical to the analogical,
or it is where figuration comes into rhetoric.</p>

<p>To look at this for a moment through a practical illustration,
let us suppose that a speaker has convinced his listeners that
his position is “true” as far as dialectical inquiry may be
pushed. Now he sets about moving the listeners toward that
position, but there is no way to move them except through the
operation of analogy. The analogy proceeds by showing that
the position being urged resembles or partakes of something
greater and finer. It will be represented, in sum, as one of the
steps leading toward ultimate good. Let us further suppose
our speaker to be arguing for the payment of a just debt. The
payment of the just debt is not itself justice, but the payment
of this particular debt is one of the many things which would
have to be done before this could be a completely just world.
It is just, then, because it partakes of the ideal justice, or it is
a small analogue of all justice (in practice it will be found that
the rhetorician makes extensive use of synecdoche, whereby
the small part is used as a vivid suggestion of the grandeur of
the whole). It is by bringing out these resemblances that the
good rhetorician leads those who listen in the direction of
what is good. In effect, he performs a cure of souls by giving
impulse, chiefly through figuration, toward an ideal good.</p>

<p>We now see the true rhetorician as a noble lover of the
good, who works through dialectic and through poetic or analogical
association. However he is compelled to modulate by
the peculiar features of an occasion, this is his method.</p>

<p>It may not be superfluous to draw attention to the fact that
what we have here outlined is the method of the <i>Phaedrus</i>
itself. The dialectic appears in the dispute about love. The
current thesis that love is praiseworthy is countered by the
antithesis that love is blameworthy. This position is fully developed
in the speech of Lysias and in the first speech of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Socrates. But this position is countered by a new thesis that
after all love is praiseworthy because it is a divine thing. Of
course, this is love on a higher level, or love re-defined. This is
the regular process of transcendence which we have noted
before. Now, having rescued love from the imputation of evil
by excluding certain things from its definition, what does
Socrates do? Quite in accordance with our analysis, he turns
rhetorician. He tries to make this love as attractive as possible
by bringing in the splendid figure of the charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the
narrower conception of this art, the allegory is the rhetoric, for
it excites and fills us with desire for this kind of love, depicted
with many terms having tendency toward the good. But in
the broader conception the art must include also the dialectic,
which succeeded in placing love in the category of divine
things before filling our imaginations with attributes of divinity.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
It is so regularly the method of Plato to follow a subtle
analysis with a striking myth that it is not unreasonable to call
him the master rhetorician. This goes far to explain why those
who reject his philosophy sometimes remark his literary art
with mingled admiration and annoyance.</p>

<p>The objection sometimes made that rhetoric cannot be used
by a lover of truth because it indulges in “exaggerations” can
be answered as follows. There is an exaggeration which is
mere wantonness, and with this the true rhetorician has nothing
to do. Such exaggeration is purely impressionistic in aim.
Like caricature, whose only object is to amuse, it seizes upon
any trait or aspect which could produce titillation and exploits
this without conscience. If all rhetoric were like this, we
should have to grant that rhetoricians are persons of very low
responsibility and their art a disreputable one. But the rhetorician
we have now defined is not interested in sensationalism.</p>

<p>The exaggeration which this rhetorician employs is not caricature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
but prophecy; and it would be a fair formulation to say
that true rhetoric is concerned with the potency of things. The
literalist, like the anti-poet described earlier, is troubled by
its failure to conform to a present reality. What he fails to appreciate
is that potentiality is a mode of existence, and that all
prophecy is about the tendency of things. The discourse of the
noble rhetorician, accordingly, will be about real potentiality
or possible actuality, whereas that of the mere exaggerator is
about unreal potentiality. Naturally this distinction rests upon
a supposal that the rhetorician has insight, and we could not
defend him in the absence of that condition. But given insight,
he has the duty to represent to us the as yet unactualized
future. It would be, for example, a misrepresentation of current
facts but not of potential ones to talk about the joys of
peace in a time of war. During the Second World War, at the
depth of Britain’s political and military disaster, Winston
Churchill likened the future of Europe to “broad sunlit uplands.”
Now if one had regard only for the hour, this was a
piece of mendacity such as the worst charlatans are found
committing; but if one took Churchill’s premises and then
considered the potentiality, the picture was within bounds of
actualization. His “exaggeration” was that the defeat of the
enemy would place Europe in a position for long and peaceful
progress. At the time the surface trends ran the other way;
the actuality was a valley of humiliation. Yet the hope which
transfigured this to “broad sunlit uplands” was not irresponsible,
and we conclude by saying that the rhetorician talks
about both what exists simply and what exists by favor of human
imagination and effort.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>This interest in actualization is a further distinction between
pure dialectic and rhetoric. With its forecast of the
actual possibility, rhetoric passes from mere scientific demonstration
of an idea to its relation to prudential conduct. A
dialectic must take place <i>in vacuo</i>, and the fact alone that it
contains contraries leaves it an intellectual thing. Rhetoric, on
the other hand, always espouses one of the contraries. This
espousal is followed by some attempt at impingement upon
actuality. That is why rhetoric, with its passion for the actual,
is more complete than mere dialectic with its dry understanding.
It is more complete on the premise that man is a creature
of passion who must live out that passion in the world. Pure
contemplation does not suffice for this end. As Jacques Maritain
has expressed it: “love ... is not directed at possibilities
or pure essences; it is directed at what exists; one does not love
possibilities, one loves that which exists or is destined to
exist.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The complete man, then, is the “lover” added to the
scientist; the rhetorician to the dialectician. Understanding
followed by actualization seems to be the order of creation,
and there is no need for the role of rhetoric to be misconceived.</p>

<p>The pure dialectician is left in the theoretical position of the
non-lover, who can attain understanding but who cannot add
impulse to truth. We are compelled to say “theoretical position”
because it is by no means certain that in the world of
actual speech the non-lover has more than a putative existence.
We have seen previously that his speech would consist
of strictly referential words which would serve only as designata.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Now the question arises: at what point is motive to
come into such language? Kenneth Burke in <i>A Grammar of
Motives</i> has pointed to “the pattern of embarrassment behind
the contemporary ideal of a language that will best promote
good action by entirely eliminating the element of exhortation
or command. Insofar as such a project succeeded, its
terms would involve a narrowing of circumference to a point
where the principle of personal action is eliminated from language,
so that an act would follow from it only as a non-sequitur,
a kind of humanitarian after-thought.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The fault of this conception of language is that scientific intention
turns out to be enclosed in artistic intention and not
<i>vice versa</i>. Let us test this by taking as an example one of
those “fact-finding committees” so favored by modern representative
governments. A language in which all else is suppressed
in favor of nuclear meanings would be an ideal instrumentality
for the report of such a committee. But this committee,
if it lived up to the ideal of its conception, would have
to be followed by an “attitude-finding committee” to tell us
what its explorations really mean. In real practice the fact-finding
committee understands well enough that it is also an
attitude-finding committee, and where it cannot show inclination
through language of tendency, it usually manages to do
so through selection and arrangement of the otherwise inarticulate
facts. To recur here to the original situation in the
dialogue, we recall that the eloquent Lysias, posing as a non-lover,
had concealed designs upon Phaedrus, so that his fine
speech was really a sheep’s clothing. Socrates discerned in him
a “peculiar craftiness.” One must suspect the same today of
many who ask us to place our faith in the neutrality of their
discourse. We cannot deny that there are degrees of objectivity
in the reference of speech. But this is not the same as an
assurance that a vocabulary of reduced meanings will solve
the problems of mankind. Many of those problems will have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to be handled, as Socrates well knew, by the student of souls,
who must primarily make use of the language of tendency.
The soul is impulse, not simply cognition; and finally one’s
interest in rhetoric depends on how much poignancy one
senses in existence.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Rhetoric moves the soul with a movement which cannot
finally be justified logically. It can only be valued analogically
with reference to some supreme image. Therefore when the
rhetorician encounters some soul “sinking beneath the double
load of forgetfulness and vice” he seeks to re-animate it by
holding up to its sight the order of presumptive goods. This
order is necessarily a hierarchy leading up to the ultimate
good. All of the terms in a rhetorical vocabulary are like links
in a chain stretching up to some master link which transmits
its influence down through the linkages. It is impossible to
talk about rhetoric as effective expression without having as
a term giving intelligibility to the whole discourse, the Good.
Of course, inferior concepts of the Good may be and often are
placed in this ultimate position; and there is nothing to keep a
base lover from inverting the proper order and saying, “Evil,
be thou my good.” Yet the fact remains that in any piece of
rhetorical discourse, one rhetorical term overcomes another
rhetorical term only by being nearer to the term which stands
ultimate. There is some ground for calling a rhetorical education
necessarily an aristocratic education in that the rhetorician
has to deal with an aristocracy of notions, to say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of supplementing his logical and pathetic proofs with an
ethical proof.</p>

<p>All things considered, rhetoric, noble or base, is a great
power in the world; and we note accordingly that at the center
of the public life of every people there is a fierce struggle
over who shall control the means of rhetorical propagation.
Today we set up “offices of information,” which like the sly
lover in the dialogue, pose as non-lovers while pushing their
suits. But there is no reason to despair over the fact that men
will never give up seeking to influence one another. We would
not desire it to be otherwise; neuter discourse is a false idol,
to worship which is to commit the very offense for which
Socrates made expiation in his second speech.</p>

<p>Since we want not emancipation from impulse but clarification
of impulse, the duty of rhetoric is to bring together action
and understanding into a whole that is greater than scientific
perception.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The realization that just as no action is really indifferent,
so no utterance is without its responsibility introduces,
it is true, a certain strenuousity into life, produced by a
consciousness that “nothing is lost.” Yet this is preferable to
that desolation which proceeds from an infinite dispersion or
feeling of unaccountability. Even so, the choice between them
is hardly ours to make; we did not create the order of things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
but being accountable for our impulses, we wish these to be
just.</p>

<p>Thus when we finally divest rhetoric of all the notions of
artifice which have grown up around it, we are left with something
very much like Spinoza’s “intellectual love of God.”
This is its essence and the <i>fons et origo</i> of its power. It is “intellectual”
because, as we have previously seen, there is no
honest rhetoric without a preceding dialectic. The kind of
rhetoric which is justly condemned is utterance in support of a
position before that position has been adjudicated with reference
to the whole universe of discourse<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>—and of such the
world always produces more than enough. It is “love” because
it is something in addition to bare theoretical truth.
That element in addition is a desire to bring truth into a kind
of existence, or to give it an actuality to which theory is indifferent.
Now what is to be said about our last expression, “of
God”? Echoes of theological warfare will cause many to desire
a substitute for this, and we should not object. As long as
we have in ultimate place the highest good man can intuit, the
relationship is made perfect. We shall be content with “intellectual
love of the Good.” It is still the intellectual love of good
which causes the noble lover to desire not to devour his beloved
but to shape him according to the gods as far as mortal
power allows. So rhetoric at its truest seeks to perfect men by
showing them better versions of themselves, links in that chain
extending up toward the ideal, which only the intellect can
apprehend and only the soul have affection for. This is the justified
affection of which no one can be ashamed, and he who
feels no influence of it is truly outside the communion of
minds. Rhetoric appears, finally, as a means by which the
impulse of the soul to be ever moving is redeemed.</p>

<p>It may be granted that in this essay we have gone some distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
from the banks of the Ilissus. What began as a simple
account of passion becomes by transcendence an allegory of
all speech. No one would think of suggesting that Plato had in
mind every application which has here been made, but that
need not arise as an issue. The structure of the dialogue, the
way in which the judgments about speech concentre, and
especially the close association of the true, the beautiful, and
the good, constitute a unity of implication. The central idea
is that all speech, which is the means the gods have given man
to express his soul, is a form of eros, in the proper interpretation
of the word. With that truth the rhetorician will always
be brought face to face as soon as he ventures beyond the consideration
of mere artifice and device.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_II">Chapter II<br />
DIALECTIC AND RHETORIC AT DAYTON, TENNESSEE</h2>

</div>

<p>We have maintained that dialectic and rhetoric are
distinguishable stages of argumentation, although
often they are not distinguished by the professional
mind, to say nothing of the popular mind. Dialectic is that
stage which defines the subject satisfactorily with regard to
the <i>logos</i>, or the set of propositions making up some coherent
universe of discourse; and we can therefore say that a dialectical
position is established when its relation to an opposite has
been made clear and it is thus rationally rather than empirically
sustained. Despite the inconclusiveness of Plato on
this subject, we shall say that facts are never dialectically determined—although
they may be elaborated in a dialectical
system—and that the urgency of facts is never a dialectical
concern. For similar reasons Professor Adler, in his searching
study of dialectic, maintains the position that “Facts, that is
non-discursive elements, are never determinative of dialectic
in a logical or intellectual sense....”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>What a successful dialectic secures for any position therefore,
as we noted in the opening chapter, is not actuality but
possibility; and what rhetoric thereafter accomplishes is to
take any dialectically secured position (since positive positions,
like the “position” that water freezes at 32°F., are not
matters for rhetorical appeal) and show its relationship to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
world of prudential conduct. This is tantamount to saying that
what the specifically rhetorical plea asks of us is belief, which
is a preliminary to action.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to state this relationship through an example
less complex than that of the Platonic dialogue. The speaker
who in a dialectical contest has taken the position that
“magnanimity is a virtue” has by his process of opposition and
exclusion won our intellectual assent, inasmuch as we see the
abstract possibility of this position in the world of discourse.
He has not, however, produced in us a resolve to practice
magnanimity. To accomplish this he must pass from the realm
of possibility to that of actuality; it is not the logical invincibility
of “magnanimity” enclosed in the class “virtue” which
wins our assent; rather it is the contemplation of magnanimity
<i>sub specie</i> actuality. Accordingly when we say that rhetoric
instills belief and action, we are saying that it intersects possibility
with the plane of actuality and hence of the imperative.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A failure to appreciate this distinction is responsible for
many lame performances in our public controversies. The effects
are, in outline, that the dialectician cannot understand
why his demonstration does not win converts; and the rhetorician
cannot understand why his appeal is rejected as specious.
The answer, as we have begun to indicate, is that the
dialectic has not made reference to reality, which men confronted
with problems of conduct require; and the rhetorician
has not searched the grounds of the position on which he has
perhaps spent much eloquence. True, the dialectician and the
rhetorician are often one man, and the two processes may not
lie apart in his work; but no student of the art of argumentation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
can doubt that some extraordinary confusions would be
prevented by a knowledge of the theory of this distinction.
Beyond this, representative government would receive a tonic
effect from any improvement of the ability of an electorate to
distinguish logical positions from the detail of rhetorical amplification.
The British, through their custom of putting questions
to public speakers and to officers of government in Parliament,
probably come nearest to getting some dialectical
clarification from their public figures. In the United States,
where there is no such custom, it is up to each disputant to
force the other to reveal his grounds; and this, in the ardor of
shoring up his own position rhetorically, he often fails to do
with any thoroughness. It should therefore be profitable to
try the kind of analysis we have explained upon some celebrated
public controversy, with the object of showing how
such grasp of rhetorical theory could have made the issues
clearer.</p>

<p>For this purpose, it would be hard to think of a better example
than the Scopes “evolution” trial of a generation ago.
There is no denying that this trial had many aspects of the
farcical, and it might seem at first glance not serious enough
to warrant this type of examination. Yet at the time it was
considered serious enough to draw the most celebrated trial
lawyers of the country, as well as some of the most eminent
scientists; moreover, after one has cut through the sensationalism
with which journalism and a few of the principals clothed
the encounter, one finds a unique alignment of dialectical and
rhetorical positions.</p>

<p>The background of the trial can be narrated briefly. On
March 21, 1925, the state of Tennessee passed a law forbidding
the teaching of the theory of evolution in publicly supported
schools. The language of the law was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of
Tennessee, that it shall be unlawful for any teacher in any of the
universities, normals and all other public schools of the state, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the
state, to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine creation
of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man
has descended from a lower order of animals.</p>

</div>

<p>That same spring John T. Scopes, a young instructor in
biology in the high school at Dayton, made an agreement
with some local citizens to teach such a theory and to cause
himself to be indicted therefor with the object of testing the
validity of the law. The indictment was duly returned, and the
two sides prepared for the contest. The issue excited the nation
as a whole; and the trial drew as opposing counsel
Clarence Darrow, the celebrated Chicago lawyer, and William
Jennings Bryan, the former political leader and evangelical
lecturer.</p>

<p>The remarkable aspect of this trial was that almost from the
first the defense, pleading the cause of science, was forced into
the role of rhetorician; whereas the prosecution, pleading the
cause of the state, clung stubbornly to a dialectical position.
This development occurred because the argument of the defense,
once the legal technicalities were got over, was that
evolution is “true.” The argument of the prosecution was that
its teaching was unlawful. These two arguments depend upon
rhetoric and dialectic respectively. Because of this circumstance,
the famous trial turned into an argument about the orders
of knowledge, although this fact was never clearly expressed,
if it was ever discerned, by either side, and that is the
main subject of our analysis. But before going into the matter
of the trial, a slight prologue may be in order.</p>

<p>It is only the first step beyond philosophic naïvete to realize
that there are different orders of knowledge, or that not all
knowledge is of the same kind of thing. Adler, whose analysis
I am satisfied to accept to some extent, distinguishes the orders
as follows. First there is the order of facts about existing
physical entities. These constitute the simple data of science.
Next come the statements which are statements about these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
facts; these are the propositions or theories of science. Next
there come the statements about these statements: “The propositions
which these last statements express form a partial
universe of discourse which is the body of philosophical opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>To illustrate in sequence: the anatomical measurements of
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> would be knowledge of the first order.
A theory based on these measurements which placed him
in a certain group of related organisms would be knowledge
of the second order. A statement about the value or the implications
of the theory of this placement would be knowledge
of the third order; it would be the judgment of a scientific
theory from a dialectical position.</p>

<p>It is at once apparent that the Tennessee “anti-evolution”
law was a statement of the third class. That is to say, it was
neither a collection of scientific facts, nor a statement about
those facts (<i>i.e.</i>, a theory or a generalization); it was a statement
about a statement (the scientists’ statement) purporting
to be based on those facts. It was, to use Adler’s phrase, a
philosophical opinion, though expressed in the language of
law. Now since the body of philosophical opinion is on a level
which surmounts the partial universe of science, how is it possible
for the latter ever to refute the former? In short, is there
any number of facts, together with generalizations based on
facts, which would be sufficient to overcome a dialectical
position?</p>

<p>Throughout the trial the defense tended to take the view
that science could carry the day just by being scientific. But in
doing this, one assumes that there are no points outside the
empirical realm from which one can form judgments about
science. Science, by this conception, must contain not only its
facts, but also the means of its own evaluation, so that the
statements about the statements of science are science too.</p>

<p>The published record of the trial runs to approximately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
three hundred pages, and it would obviously be difficult to
present a digest of all that was said. But through a carefully
selected series of excerpts, it may be possible to show how
blows were traded back and forth from the two positions. The
following passages, though not continuous, afford the clearest
picture of the dialectical-rhetorical conflict which underlay
the entire trial.</p>

<p>You will bear in mind that in this investigation you are not interested

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Darrow</i>: I don’t suppose the
court has considered the question
of competency of evidence.
My associates and myself have
fairly definite ideas as to it, but
I don’t know how the counsel on
the other side feel about it. I
think that scientists are competent
evidence—or competent
witnesses here, to explain what
evolution is, and that they are
competent on both sides.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Attorney-General Stewart</i>: If the
Court please, in this case, as Mr.
Darrow stated, the defense is
going to insist on introducing
scientists and Bible students to
give their ideas on certain views
of this law, and that, I am frank
to state, will be resisted by the
state as vigorously as we know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
how to resist it. We have had a
conference or two about the
matter, and we think that it isn’t
competent evidence; that is, it is
not competent to bring into this
case scientists who testify as to
what the theory of evolution is
or interpret the Bible or anything
of that sort.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Neal</i>: The defendant moves
the court to quash the indictment
in this case for the following
reasons: In that it violates
Sec. 12, Art. XI, of the Constitution
of Tennessee: “It shall be
the duty of the general assembly
in all future periods of the government
to cherish literature
and science....” I want to say
that our main contention after
all, may it please your honor, is
that this is not a proper thing
for any legislature, the legislature
of Tennessee or the legislature
of the United States, to
attempt to make and assign a
rule in regard to. In this law
there is an attempt to pronounce
a judgment and a conclusion in
the realm of science and in the
realm of religion.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. McKenzie</i>: Under the law
you cannot teach in the common
schools the Bible. Why should
it be improper to provide that
you cannot teach this other
theory?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Darrow</i>: Can a legislative
body say, “You cannot read a
book or take a lesson or make a
talk on science until you first
find out whether you are saying
against Genesis”? It can unless
that constitutional provision
protects me. It can. Can it say
to the astronomer, you cannot
turn your telescope upon the infinite
planets and suns and stars
that fill space, lest you find that
the earth is not the center of the
universe and that there is not
any firmament between us and
the heaven? Can it? It could—except
for the work of Thomas
Jefferson, which has been woven
into every state constitution
in the Union, and has stayed
there like a flaming sword to
protect the rights of man against
ignorance and bigotry, and
when it is permitted to overwhelm
them then we are taken
in a sea of blood and ruin that
all the miseries and tortures and
carrion of the middle ages
would be as nothing.... If today
you can take a thing like
evolution and make it a crime
to teach it in the public schools,
tomorrow you can make it a
crime to teach it in the private
schools, and the next year you
can make it a crime to teach it
to the hustings or in the church.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
At the next session you may ban
books and the newspapers.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Dudley Field Malone</i>: So
that there shall be no misunderstanding
and that no one shall
be able to misinterpret or misrepresent
our position we wish
to state at the beginning of the
case that the defense believes
that there is a direct conflict between
the theory of evolution
and the theories of creation as
set forth in the Book of Genesis.</p>

<p>Neither do we believe that
the stories of creation as set
forth in the Bible are reconcilable
or scientifically correct.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Arthur Garfield Hays</i>: Our
whole case depends upon proving
that evolution is a reasonable
scientific theory.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. William Jennings Bryan, Jr.</i>
(in support of a motion to exclude
expert testimony): It is, I
think, apparent to all that we
have now reached the heart of
this case, upon your honor’s ruling,
as to whether this expert
testimony will be admitted
largely determines the question
of whether this trial from now
on will be an orderly effort to
try the case upon the issues,
raised by the indictment and by
the plea or whether it will degenerate
into a joint debate upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the merits or demerits of
someone’s views upon evolution....
To permit an expert to
testify upon this issue would be
to substitute trial by experts for
trial by jury....</p>

</div>

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Hays</i>: Are we entitled to
show what evolution is? We are
entitled to show that, if for no
other reason than to determine
whether the title is germane to
the act.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. William Jennings Bryan</i>: An
expert cannot be permitted to
come in here and try to defeat
the enforcement of a law by
testifying that it isn’t a bad law
and it isn’t—I mean a bad doctrine—no
matter how these people
phrase the doctrine—no
matter how they eulogize it.
This is not the place to prove
that the law ought never to have
been passed. The place to prove
that, or teach that, was to the
state legislature.... The people
of this state passed this law, the
people of the state knew what
they were doing when they
passed the law, and they knew
the dangers of the doctrine—that
they did not want it taught
to their children, and my friends,
it isn’t—your honor, it isn’t
proper to bring experts in here
and try to defeat the purpose of
the people of this state by trying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
to show that this thing they
denounce and outlaw is a beautiful
thing that everybody ought
to believe in.... It is this doctrine
that gives us Nietzsche, the
only great author who tried to
carry this to its logical conclusion,
and we have the testimony
of my distinguished friend from
Chicago in his speech in the
Loeb and Leopold case that 50,000
volumes have been written
about Nietzsche, and he is the
greatest philosopher in the last
hundred years, and have him
pleading that because Leopold
read Nietzsche and adopted Nietzsche’s
philosophy of the super-man,
that he is not responsible
for the taking of human life. We
have the doctrine—I should not
characterize it as I should like
to characterize it—the doctrine
that the universities that had it
taught, and the professors who
taught it, are much more responsible
for the crime that Leopold
committed than Leopold
himself. That is the doctrine,
my friends, that they have tried
to bring into existence, they
commence in the high schools
with their foundation of evolutionary
theory, and we have the
word of the distinguished lawyer
that this is more read than
any other in a hundred years,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and the statement of that distinguished
man that the teachings
of Nietzsche made Leopold
a murderer.... (<i>Mr. Bryan
reading from a book by Darrow</i>)
“I will guarantee that you
can go to the University of Chicago
today—into its big library
and find over 1,000 volumes of
Nietzsche, and I am sure I speak
moderately. If this boy is to
blame for this, where did he get
it? Is there any blame attached
because somebody took Nietzsche’s
philosophy seriously and
fashioned his life on it? And
there is no question in this case
but what it is true. Then who is
to blame? The university would
be more to blame than he is. The
scholars of the world would be
more to blame than he is. The
publishers of the world—and
Nietzsche’s books are published
by one of the biggest publishers
in the world—are more to blame
than he is. Your honor, it is
hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old
boy for the philosophy that was
taught him at the university.”...
Your honor, we first pointed
out that we do not need any experts
in science. Here is one
plain fact, and the statute defines
itself, and it tells the kind
of evolution it does not want
taught, and the evidence says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that this is the kind of evolution
that was taught, and no number
of scientists could come in here,
my friends, and override that
statute or take from the jury its
right to decide this question, so
that all the experts they could
bring would mean nothing. And
when it comes to Bible experts,
every member of the jury is as
good an expert on the Bible as
any man they could bring, or
that we could bring.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Malone</i>: Are we to have our
children know nothing about
science except what the church
says they shall know? I have
never seen any harm in learning
and understanding, in humility
and open-mindedness, and I
have never seen clearer the need
of that learning than when I see
the attitude of the prosecution,
who attack and refuse to accept
the information and intelligence,
which expert witnesses
will give them.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stewart</i>: Now what could
these scientists testify to? They
could only say as an expert,
qualified as an expert upon this
subject, I have made a study of
these things and from my standpoint
as such an expert, I say
that this does not deny the story
of divine creation. That is what
they would testify to, isn’t it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
That is all they could testify
about.</p>

<p>Now, then, I say under the
correct construction of the act,
that they cannot testify as to
that. Why? Because in the wording
of this act the legislature
itself construed the instrument
according to their intention....
What was the general purpose
of the legislature here? It was to
prevent teaching in the public
schools of any county in Tennessee
that theory which says
that man is descended from a
lower order of animals. That is
the intent and nobody can dispute
it under the shining sun of
this day.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Court</span></p>

<p>Now upon these issues as brought up it becomes the duty of the
Court to determine the question of the admissibility of this expert
testimony offered by the defendant.</p>

<p>It is not within the province of the Court under these issues to
decide and determine which is true, the story of divine creation as
taught in the Bible, or the story of the creation of man as taught
by evolution.</p>

<p>If the state is correct in its insistence, it is immaterial, so far as
the results of this case are concerned, as to which theory is true;
because it is within the province of the legislative branch, and not
the judicial branch of the government to pass upon the policy of a
statute; and the policy of this statute having been passed upon by
that department of the government, this court is not further concerned
as to its policy; but is interested only in its proper interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and, if valid, its enforcement.... Therefore the court is
content to sustain the motion of the attorney-general to exclude
expert testimony.</p>

<div class="column-left">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prosecution</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stewart</i> (during Mr. Darrow’s
cross-examination of Mr.
Bryan): I want to interpose
another objection. What is the
purpose of this examination?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bryan</i>: The purpose is to
cast ridicule upon everybody
who believes in the Bible, and I
am perfectly willing that the
world shall know that these gentlemen
have no other purpose
than ridiculing every Christian
who believes in the Bible.</p>

</div>

<div class="column-right">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Defense</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Darrow</i>: We have the purpose
of preventing bigots and
ignoramuses from controlling
the education of the United
States, and you know it, and that
is all.</p>

<p>Statements of Noted Scientists
as Filed into Record by Defense
Counsel</p>

<p><i>Charles H. Judd, Director of
School of Education, University
of Chicago</i>: It will be impossible,
in my judgment, in the
state university, as well as in the
normal schools, to teach adequately
psychology or the science
of education without making
constant reference to all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
facts of mental development
which are included in the general
doctrine of evolution....
Whatever may be the constitutional
rights of legislatures to
prescribe the general course of
study of public schools it will,
in my judgment, be a serious
national disaster if the attempt
is successful to determine the
details to be taught in the
schools through the vote of legislatures
rather than as a result
of scientific investigation.</p>

<p><i>Jacob G. Lipman, Dean of the
College of Agriculture, State
University of New Jersey</i>: With
these facts and interpretations
of organic evolution left out, the
agricultural colleges and experimental
stations could not render
effective service to our great
agricultural industry.</p>

<p><i>Wilbur A. Nelson, State Geologist
of Tennessee</i>: It, therefore,
appears that it would be impossible
to study or teach geology
in Tennessee or elsewhere, without
using the theory of evolution.</p>

<p><i>Kirtley F. Mather, Chairman of
the Department of Geology,
Harvard University</i>: Science has
not even a guess as to the original
source or sources of matter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
It deals with immediate causes
and effects.... Men of science
have as their aim the discovery
of facts. They seek with open
eyes, willing to recognize it, as
Huxley said, even if it “sears
the eyeballs.” After they have
discovered truth, and not till
then, do they consider what its
moral implications may be. Thus
far, and presumably always,
truth when found is also found
to be right, in the moral sense
of the word.... As Henry Ward
Beecher said, forty years ago,
“If to reject God’s revelation in
the book is infidelity, what is it
to reject God’s revelation of
himself in the structure of the
whole globe?”</p>

<p><i>Maynard M. Metcalf, Research
Specialist in Zoology, Johns
Hopkins University</i>: Intelligent
teaching of biology or intelligent
approach to any biological science
is impossible if the established
fact of evolution is omitted.</p>

<p><i>Horatio Hackett Newman, Professor
of Zoology, University of
Chicago</i>: Evolution has been
tried and tested in every conceivable
way for considerably
over half a century. Vast numbers
of biological facts have
been examined in the light of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
this principle and without a
single exception they have been
entirely compatible with it....
The evolution principle is thus
a great unifying and integrating
scientific conception. Any conception
that is so far-reaching,
so consistent, and that has led
to so much advance in the understanding
of nature, is at least
an extremely valuable idea and
one not lightly to be cast aside
in case it fails to agree with one’s
prejudices.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Thus the two sides lined up as dialectical truth and empirical
fact. The state legislature of Tennessee, acting in its sovereign
capacity, had passed a measure which made it unlawful to
teach that man is connatural with the animals through asserting
that he is descended from a “lower order” of them. (There
was some sparring over the meaning of the technical language
of the act, but this was the general consensus.) The legal
question was whether John T. Scopes had violated the measure.
The philosophical question, which was the real focus of
interest, was the right of a state to make this prescription.</p>

<p>We have referred to the kind of truth which can be dialectically
established, and here we must develop further the
dialectical nature of the state’s case. As long as it maintained
this dialectical position, it did not have to go into the “factual”
truth of evolution, despite the outcry from the other side. The
following considerations, then, enter into this “dialectical”
prosecution.</p>

<p>By definition the legislature is the supreme arbiter of education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
within the state. It is charged with the duty of promoting
enlightenment and morality, and to these ends it may
establish common schools, require attendance, and review
curricula either by itself or through its agents. The state of
Tennessee had exercised this kind of authority when it had
forbidden the teaching of the Bible in the public schools. Now
if the legislature could take a position that the publicly subsidized
teaching of the Bible was socially undesirable, it could,
from the same authority, take the same position with regard to
a body of science. Some people might feel that the legislature
was morally bound to encourage the propagation of the Bible,
just as some of those participating in the trial seemed to think
that it was morally bound to encourage the propagation of
science. But here again the legislature is the highest tribunal,
and no body of religious or scientific doctrine comes to it with
a compulsive authority. In brief, both the Ten Commandments
and the theory of evolution belonged in the class of
things which it could elect or reject, depending on the systematic
import of propositions underlying the philosophy of
the state.</p>

<p>The policy of the anti-evolution law was the same type of
policy which Darrow had by inference commended only a
year earlier in the famous trial of Loeb and Leopold. This
clash is perhaps the most direct in the Scopes case and deserves
pointing out here. Darrow had served as defense counsel
for the two brilliant university graduates who had conceived
the idea of committing a murder as a kind of intellectual
exploit, to prove that their powers of foresight and care
could prevent detection. The essence of Darrow’s plea at their
trial was that the two young men could not be held culpable—at
least in the degree the state claimed—because of the influences
to which they had been exposed. They had been readers
of a system of philosophy of allegedly anti-social tendency,
and they were not to be blamed if they translated that philosophy
into a sanction of their deed. The effect of this plea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
obviously was to transfer guilt from the two young men to
society as a whole, acting through its laws, its schools, its
publications, etc.</p>

<p>Now the key thing to be observed in this plea was that Darrow
was not asking the jury to inspect the philosophy of
Nietzsche for the purpose either of passing upon its internal
consistency or its contact with reality. He was asking precisely
what Bryan was asking of the jury at Dayton, namely that they
take a strictly dialectical position outside it, viewing it as a
partial universe of discourse with consequences which could
be adjudged good or bad. The point to be especially noted is
that Darrow did not raise the question of whether the philosophy
of Nietzsche expresses necessary truth, or whether, let us
say, it is essential to an understanding of the world. He was
satisfied to point out that the state had not been a sufficiently
vigilant guardian of the forces molding the character of its
youth.</p>

<p>But the prosecution at Dayton could use this line of argument
without change. If the philosophy of Nietzsche were
sufficient to instigate young men to criminal actions, it might
be claimed with even greater force that the philosophy of evolution,
which in the popular mind equated man with the animals,
would do the same. The state’s dialectic here simply
used one of Darrow’s earlier definitions to place the anti-evolution
law in a favorable or benevolent category. In sum:
to Darrow’s previous position that the doctrine of Nietzsche is
capable of immoral influence, Bryan responded that the doctrine
of evolution is likewise capable of immoral influence, and
this of course was the dialectical countering of the defense’s
position in the trial.</p>

<p>There remains yet a third dialectical maneuver for the
prosecution. On the second day of the trial Attorney-General
Stewart, in reviewing the duties of the legislature, posed the
following problem: “Supposing then that there should come
within the minds of the people a conflict between literature
and science. Then what would the legislature do? Wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
they have to interpret?... Wouldn’t they have to interpret
their construction of this conflict which one should be recognized
or higher or more in the public schools?”</p>

<p>This point was not exploited as fully as its importance might
seem to warrant; but what the counsel was here declaring is
that the legislature is necessarily the umpire in all disputes
between partial universes. Therefore if literature and science
should fall into a conflict, it would again be up to the legislature
to assign the priority. It is not bound to recognize the
claims of either of these exclusively because, as we saw earlier,
it operates in a universe with reference to which these are
partial bodies of discourse. The legislature is the disposer of
partial universes. Accordingly when the Attorney-General
took this stand, he came the nearest of any of the participants
in the trial to clarifying the state’s position, and by this we
mean to showing that for the state it was a matter of legal
dialectic.</p>

<p>There is little evidence to indicate that the defense understood
the kind of case it was up against, though naturally this
is said in a philosophical rather than a legal sense. After the
questions of law were settled, its argument assumed the substance
of a plea for the truth of evolution, which subject was
not within the scope of the indictment. We have, for example,
the statement of Mr. Hays already cited that the whole case of
the defense depended on proving that evolution is a “reasonable
scientific theory.” Of those who spoke for the defense,
Mr. Dudley Field Malone seems to have had the poorest conception
of the nature of the contest. I must cite further from
his plea because it shows most clearly the trap from which the
defense was never able to extricate itself. On the fifth day of
the trial Mr. Malone was chosen to reply to Mr. Bryan, and in
the course of his speech he made the following revealing utterance:
“Your honor, there is a difference between theological
and scientific men. Theology deals with something that is
established and revealed; it seeks to gather material which
they claim should not be changed. It is the Word of God and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
that cannot be changed; it is literal, it is not to be interpreted.
That is the theological mind. It deals with theology. The scientific
mind is a modern thing, your honor. I am not sure Galileo
was the one who brought relief to the scientific mind; because,
theretofore, Aristotle and Plato had reached their conclusions
and processes, by metaphysical reasoning, because they had
no telescope and no microscope.” The part of this passage
which gives his case away is the distinction made at the end.
Mr. Malone was asserting that Aristotle and Plato got no further
than they did because they lacked the telescope and the
microscope. To a slight extent perhaps Aristotle was what we
would today call a “research scientist,” but the conclusions
and processes arrived at by the metaphysical reasoning of the
two are dialectical, and the test of a dialectical position is logic
and not ocular visibility. At the risk of making Mr. Malone a
scapegoat we must say that this is an abysmal confusion of
two different kinds of inquiry which the Greeks were well
cognizant of. But the same confusion, if it did not produce this
trial, certainly helped to draw it out to its length of eight days.
It is the assumption that human laws stand in wait upon what
the scientists see in their telescopes and microscopes. But
harking back to Professor Adler: facts are never determinative
of dialectic in the sense presumed by this counsel.</p>

<p>Exactly the same confusion appeared in a rhetorical plea
for truth which Mr. Malone made shortly later in the same
speech. Then he said: “There is never a duel with truth. The
truth always wins and we are not afraid of it. The truth is no
coward. The truth does not need the law. The truth does not
need the forces of government. The truth does not need Mr.
Bryan. The truth is imperishable, eternal and immortal and
needs no human agency to support it. We are ready to tell the
truth as we understand it and we do not fear all the truth that
they can present as facts.” It is instantly apparent that this presents
truth in an ambiguous sense. Malone begins with the simplistic
assumption that there is a “standard” truth, a kind of
universal, objective, operative truth which it is heinous to oppose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
That might be well enough if the meaning were highly
generic, but before he is through this short passage he has
equated truth with facts—the identical confusion which we
noted in his utterance about Plato and Aristotle. Now since
the truth which dialectic arrives at is not a truth of facts, this
peroration either becomes irrelevant, or it lends itself to the
other side, where, minus the concluding phrase, it could serve
as a eulogium of dialectical truth.</p>

<p>Such was the dilemma by which the defense was impaled
from the beginning. To some extent it appears even in the expert
testimony. On the day preceding this speech by Malone,
Professor Maynard Metcalf had presented testimony in court
regarding the theory of evolution (this was on the fourth day
of the trial; Judge Raulston did not make his ruling excluding
such testimony until the sixth day) in which he made some
statements which could have been of curious interest to the
prosecution. They are effectually summarized in the following
excerpt: “Evolution and the theories of evolution are fundamentally
different things. The fact of evolution is a thing that
is perfectly and absolutely clear.... The series of evidences is
so convincing that I think it would be entirely impossible for
any normal human being who was conversant with the phenomena
to have even for a moment the least doubt even for
the fact of evolution, but he might have tremendous doubts as
to the truth of any hypothesis....”</p>

<p>We first notice here a clear recognition of the kinds of truth
distinguished by Adler, with the “fact” of evolution belonging
to the first order and theories of evolution belonging to
the second. The second, which is referred to by the term
“hypothesis,” consists of facts in an elaboration. We note
furthermore that this scientist has called them fundamentally
different things—so different that one is entitled to have not
merely doubts but “tremendous doubts” about the second.
Now let us imagine the dialecticians of the opposite side approaching
him with the following. You have said, Professor
Metcalf, that the fact of evolution and the various theories of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
evolution are two quite different things. You have also said
that the theories of evolution are so debatable or questionable
that you can conceive of much difference of opinion about
them. Now if there is an order of knowledge above this order
of theories, which order you admit to be somewhat speculative,
a further order of knowledge which is philosophical or
evaluative, is it not likely that there would be in this realm still
more alternative positions, still more room for doubt or difference
of opinion? And if all this is so, would you expect people
to assent to a proposition of this order in the same way you expect
them to assent to, say, the proposition that a monkey has
vertebrae? And if you do make these admissions, can you any
longer maintain that people of opposite views on the teaching
of evolution are simply defiers of the truth? This is how the
argument might have progressed had some Greek Darwin
thrown Athens into an uproar; but this argument was, after
all, in an American court of law.</p>

<p>It should now be apparent from these analyses that the defense
was never able to meet the state’s case on dialectical
grounds. Even if it had boldly accepted the contest on this
level, it is difficult to see how it could have won, for the dialectic
must probably have followed this course: First Proposition,
All teaching of evolution is harmful. Counter Proposition,
No teaching of evolution is harmful. Resolution, Some
teaching of evolution is harmful. Now the resolution was
exactly the position taken by the law, which was that some
teaching of evolution (i.e., the teaching of it in state-supported
schools) was an anti-social measure. Logically speaking,
the proposition that “Some teaching of evolution is harmful,”
does not exclude the proposition that “Some teaching of evolution
is not harmful,” but there was the fact that the law permitted
some teaching of evolution (e.g., the teaching of it in
schools not supported by the public funds). In this situation
there seemed nothing for the defense to do but stick by the
second proposition and plead for that proposition rhetorically.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
So science entered the juridical arena and argued for the value
of science. In this argument the chief topic was consequence.
There was Malone’s statement that without the theory of evolution
Burbank would not have been able to produce his results.
There was Lipman’s statement that without an understanding
of the theory of evolution the agricultural colleges
could not carry on their work. There were the statements of
Judd and Nelson that large areas of education depended upon
a knowledge of evolution. There was the argument brought
out by Professor Mather of Harvard: “When men are offered
their choice between science, with its confident and unanimous
acceptance of the evolutionary principle, on the one
hand, and religion, with its necessary appeal to things unseen
and improvable, on the other, they are much more likely to
abandon religion than to abandon science. If such a choice is
forced upon us, the churches will lose many of their best educated
young people, the very ones upon whom they must depend
for leadership in coming years.”</p>

<p>We noted at the beginning of this chapter that rhetoric
deals with subjects at the point where they touch upon actuality
or prudential conduct. Here the defense looks at the policy
of teaching evolution and points to beneficial results. The argument
then becomes: these important benefits imply an important
beneficial cause. This is why we can say that the pleaders
for science were forced into the non-scientific role of the
rhetorician.</p>

<p>The prosecution incidentally also had an argument from
consequences, although it was never employed directly. When
Bryan maintained that the philosophy of evolution might lead
to the same results as the philosophy of Nietzsche had led with
Loeb and Leopold, he was opening a subject which could have
supplied such an argument, say in the form of a concrete instance
of moral beliefs weakened by someone’s having been
indoctrinated with evolution. But there was really no need: as
we have sought to show all along, the state had an immense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
strategic advantage in the fact that laws belong to the category
of dialectical determinations, and it clung firmly to this
advantage.</p>

<p>An irascible exchange which Darrow had with the judge
gives an idea of the frustration which the defense felt at this
stage. There had been an argument about the propriety of a
cross-examination.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The Court</i>: Colonel [Darrow], what is the purpose of cross-examination?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Darrow</i>: The purpose of cross-examination is to be used
on trial.</p>

<p><i>The Court</i>: Well, isn’t that an effort to ascertain the truth?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Darrow</i>: No, it is an effort to show prejudice. Nothing else.
Has there been any effort to ascertain the truth in this case? Why
not bring in the jury and let us prove it?</p>

</div>

<p>The truth referred to by the judge was whether the action
of Scopes fell within the definition of the law; the truth referred
to by Darrow was the facts of evolution (not submitted
to the jury as evidence); and “prejudice” was a crystallized
opinion of the theory of evolution, expressed now as law.</p>

<p>If we have appeared here to assign too complete a forensic
victory to the prosecution, let us return, by way of recapitulating
the issues, to the relationship between positive science
and dialectic. Many people, perhaps a majority in this country,
have felt that the position of the State of Tennessee was
absurd because they are unable to see how a logical position
can be taken without reference to empirical situations. But it
is just the nature of logic and dialectic to be a science without
any content as it is the nature of biology or any positive science
to be a science of empirical content.</p>

<p>We see the nature of this distinction when we realize that
there is never an argument, in the true sense of the term, about
facts. When facts are disputed, the argument must be suspended
until the facts are settled. Not until then may it be resumed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
for all true argument is about the meaning of established
or admitted facts. And since this meaning is always expressed
in propositions, we can say further that all argument
is about the systematic import of propositions. While that remains
so, the truth of the theory of evolution or of any scientific
theory can never be settled in a court of law. The court
could admit the facts into the record, but the process of legal
determination would deal with the meaning of the facts, and
it could not go beyond saying that the facts comport, or do not
comport, with the meanings of other propositions. Thus its
task is to determine their place in a system of discourse and if
possible to effect a resolution in accordance with the movement
of dialectic. It is necessary that logic in its position as
ultimate arbiter preserve this indifference toward that actuality
which is the touchstone of scientific fact.</p>

<p>It is plain that those who either expected or hoped that
science would win a sweeping victory in the Tennessee courtroom
were the same people who believe that science can take
the place of speculative wisdom. The only consolation they
had in the course of the trial was the embarrassment to which
Darrow brought Bryan in questioning him about the Bible and
the theory of evolution (during which Darrow did lead Bryan
into some dialectical traps). But in strict consideration all of
this was outside the bounds of the case because both the facts
of evolution and the facts of the Bible were “items not in discourse,”
to borrow a phrase employed by Professor Adler.
That is to say, their correctness had to be determined by scientific
means of investigation, if at all; but the relationship between
the law and theories of man’s origin could be determined
only by legal casuistry, in the non-pejorative sense of
that phrase.</p>

<p>As we intimated at the beginning, a sufficient grasp of what
the case was about would have resulted in there being no case,
or in there being quite a different case. As the events turned
out science received, in the popular estimation, a check in the
trial but a moral victory, and this only led to more misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the province of science in human affairs. The law
of the State of Tennessee won a victory which was regarded
as pyrrhic because it was generally felt to have made the law
and the lawmakers look foolish. This also was a disservice to
the common weal. Both of these results could have been prevented
if it had been understood that science is one thing and
law another. An understanding of that truth would seem to
require some general dissemination throughout our educated
classes of a <i>Summa Dialectica</i>. This means that the educated
people of our country would have to be so trained that they
could see the dialectical possibility of the opposites of the beliefs
they possess. And that is a very large order for education
in any age.</p>

EDMUND BURKE AND THE ARGUMENT FROM CIRCUMSTANCE</h2>

</div>

<p>We are now in position to affirm that the rhetorical
study of an argument begins with a study of the
sources. But since almost any extended argument
will draw upon more than one source we must look, to answer
the inquiry we are now starting, at the prevailing source, or
the source which is most frequently called upon in the total
persuasive effort. We shall say that this predominating source
gives to the argument an aspect, and our present question is,
what can be inferred from the aspect of any argument or body
of arguments about the philosophy of its maker? All men argue
alike when they argue validly because the modes of inference
are formulas, from which deviation is error. Therefore we
characterize inference only as valid or invalid. But the reasoner
reveals his philosophical position by the source of argument
which appears most often in his major premise because
the major premise tells us how he is thinking about the world.
In other words, the rhetorical content of the major premise
which the speaker habitually uses is the key to his primary
view of existence. We are of course excluding artful choices
which have in view only <i>ad hoc</i> persuasions. Putting the matter
now figuratively, we may say that no man escapes being
branded by the premise that he regards as most efficacious
in an argument. The general importance of this is that major
premises, in addition to their logical function as part of a deductive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
argument, are expressive of values, and a characteristic
major premise characterizes the user.</p>

<p>To see this principle in application, let us take three of the
chief sources of argument recognized by the classical rhetoricians.
We may look first at the source which is <i>genus</i>. All
arguments made through genus are arguments based on the
nature of the thing which is said to constitute the genus. What
the argument from genus then says is that “generic” classes
have a nature which can be predicated of their species. Thus
<i>man</i> has a nature including <i>mortality</i>, which quality can therefore
be predicated of the man Socrates and the man John
Smith. The underlying postulate here, that things have a nature,
is of course a disputable view of the world, for it involves
the acceptance of a realm of essence. Yet anyone who uses
such source of argument is committed to this wider assumption.
Now it follows that those who habitually argue from
genus are in their personal philosophy idealists. To them the
idea of genus is a reflection of existence. We are saying, accordingly,
that arguments which make predominant use of
genus have an aspect through this source, and that the aspect
may be employed to distinguish the philosophy of the author.
It will be found, to cite a concrete example, that John Henry
Newman regularly argues from genus; he begins with the nature
of the thing and then makes the application. The question
of what a university is like is answered by applying the
idea of a university. The question of what man ought to study
is answered by working out a conception of the nature of man.
And we shall find in a succeeding essay that Abraham Lincoln,
although he has become a patron for liberals and pragmatists,
was a consistent user of the argument from genus. His refusal
to hedge on the principle of slavery is referable to a fixed concept
of the nature of man. This, then, will serve to characterize
the argument from genus.</p>

<p>Another important source of argument is <i>similitude</i>. Whereas
those who argue from genus argue from a fixed class, those
who argue from similitude invoke essential (though not exhaustive)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
correspondences. If one were to say, for example,
that whatever has the divine attribute of reason is likely to
have also the divine attribute of immortality, one would be
using similitude to establish a probability. Thinkers of the
analogical sort use this argument chiefly. If required to characterize
the outlook it implies, we should say that it expresses
belief in a oneness of the world, which causes all correspondence
to have probative value. Proponents of this view
tend to look toward some final, transcendental unity, and as
we might expect, this type of argument is used widely by poets
and religionists.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> John Bunyan used it constantly; so did
Emerson.</p>

<p>A third type we shall mention, the type which provides our
access to Burke, is the argument from <i>circumstance</i>. The
argument from circumstance is, as the name suggests, the
nearest of all arguments to purest expediency. This argument
merely reads the circumstances—the “facts standing around”—and
accepts them as coercive, or allows them to dictate the
decision. If one should say, “The city must be surrendered because
the besiegers are so numerous,” one would be arguing
not from genus, or similitude, but from a present circumstance.
The expression “In view of the situation, what else are you
going to do?” constitutes a sort of proposition-form for this
type of argument. Such argument savors of urgency rather
than of perspicacity; and it seems to be preferred by those
who are easily impressed by existing tangibles. Whereas the
argument from consequence attempts a forecast of results, the
argument from circumstance attempts only an estimate of
current conditions or pressures. By thus making present circumstance
the overbearing consideration, it keeps from sight
even the nexus of cause and effect. It is the least philosophical
of all the sources of argument, since theoretically it stops at
the level of perception of fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Burke is widely respected as a conservative who was intelligent
enough to provide solid philosophical foundations for his
conservatism. It is perfectly true that many of his observations
upon society have a conservative basis; but if one studies
the kind of argument which Burke regularly employed when
at grips with concrete policies, one discovers a strong addiction
to the argument from circumstance. Now for reasons
which will be set forth in detail later, the argument from circumstance
is the argument philosophically appropriate to the
liberal. Indeed, one can go much further and say that it is the
argument fatal to conservatism. However much Burke eulogized
tradition and fulminated against the French Revolution,
he was, when judged by what we are calling aspect of argument,
very far from being a conservative; and we suggest here
that a man’s method of argument is a truer index in his beliefs
than his explicit profession of principles. Here is a means
whereby he is revealed in his work. Burke’s voluminous controversies
give us ample opportunity to test him by this rule.</p>

<p>There is some point in beginning with Burke’s treatment of
the existing Catholic question, an issue which drew forth one
of his earliest political compositions and continued to engage
his attention throughout his life. As early as 1765 he had become
concerned with the extraordinary legal disabilities imposed
upon Catholics in Ireland, and about this time he undertook
a treatise entitled <i>Tract on the Popery Laws</i>. Despite the
fact that in this treatise Burke professes belief in natural law,
going so far as to assert that all human laws are but declaratory,
the type of argument he uses chiefly is the secular argument
from circumstance. After a review of the laws and penalties,
he introduces his “capital consideration.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The first and most capital consideration with regard to this, as
to every object, is the extent of it. And here it is necessary to premise:
this system of penalty and incapacity has for its object no
small sect or obscure party, but a very numerous body of men—a
body which comprehends at least two thirds of the whole nation:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
it amounts to 2,800,000 souls, a number sufficient for the materials
constituent of a great people.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He then gave his reason for placing the circumstance first.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This consideration of the magnitude of the object ought to attend
us through the whole inquiry: if it does not always affect the reason,
it is always decisive on the importance of the question. It not only
makes itself a more leading point, but complicates itself with every
other part of the matter, giving every error, minute in itself, a
character and a significance from its application. It is therefore not
to be wondered at, if we perpetually recur to it in the course of this
essay.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Tract</i> was planned in such a way as to continue this
thought, while accompanying it with discussion of the impediment
to national prosperity, and of “the impolicy of those laws,
as they affect the national security.” This early effort established
the tenor of his thinking on the subject.</p>

<p>While representing Bristol in Parliament, Burke alienated
a part of his constituency by supporting Sir George Savile’s
measure to ease the restraints upon Catholics. In the famous
<i>Speech to the Electors of Bristol</i> he devoted a large portion of
his time to a justification of that course, and here, it is true, he
made principal use of the argument from genus (“justice”)
and from consequence. The argument from circumstance is
not forgotten, but is tucked away at the end to persuade the
“bigoted enemies to liberty.” There, using again his criterion
of the “magnitude of the object,” he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Gentlemen, it is possible you may not know that the people of
that persuasion in Ireland amount to at least sixteen or seventeen
hundred thousand souls. I do not at all exaggerate the number.
A nation to be <i>persecuted</i>! Whilst we were masters of the sea, embodied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
with America and in alliance with half the powers of the
continent, we might, perhaps, in that remote corner of Europe,
afford to tyrannize with impunity. But there is a revolution in our
affairs which makes it prudent for us to be just.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

</div>

<p>During the last decade of his life, Burke wrote a series of
letters upon the Catholic question and upon Irish affairs, in
which, of course, this question figured largely. In 1792 came
<i>A Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe, M.P.</i>, upon the propriety
of admitting Catholics to the elective franchise. Here we find
him taking a pragmatic view of liberality toward Catholics.
He reasoned as follows regarding the restoration of the franchise:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If such means can with any probability be shown, from circumstances,
rather to add strength to our mixed ecclesiastical and
secular constitution, than to weaken it; surely they are means infinitely
to be preferred to penalties, incapacities, and proscriptions
continued from generation to generation.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this instance the consideration of magnitude took a more
extended form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>How much more, certainly, ought they [the disqualifying laws]
to give way, when, as in our case, they affect, not here and there, in
some particular point or in their consequence, but universally,
collectively and directly, the fundamental franchises of a people,
equal to the whole inhabitants of several respectable kingdoms and
states, equal to the subjects of the kings of Sardinia or of Denmark;
equal to those of the United Netherlands, and more than are to be
found in all the states of Switzerland. This way of proscribing men
by whole nations, as it were, from all the benefits of the constitution
to which they were born, I never can believe to be politic or
expedient, much less necessary for the existence of any state or
church in the world.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Greatly exercised over events in France, Burke came to
think of Christianity as the one force with enough cohesion to
check the spread of the Revolution. Then in 1795 he wrote the
<i>Letter to William Smith, Esq.</i> Here he described Christianity
as “the grand prejudice ... which holds all the other prejudices
together”;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and such prejudices, as he visualized them, were
essential to the fabric of society. He told his correspondent
candidly: “My whole politics, at present, center in one point;
and to this the merit or demerit of every measure (with me)
is referable; that is, what will most promote or depress the
cause of Jacobinism.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In a second letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe,
written in the same year, he could say: “In the Catholic
Question I considered only one point. Was it at the time, and
in the circumstances, a measure which tended to promote the
concord of the citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Only once did Burke approach the question of religion
through what may be properly termed an argument from definition.
In the last year of his life he composed <i>A Letter on the
Affairs of Ireland</i>, one passage of which considers religion not
in its bearing upon some practical measure, but with reference
to its essential nature.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Let every man be as pious as he pleases, and in the way that he
pleases; but it is agreeable neither to piety nor to policy to give
exclusively all manner of civil privileges and advantages to a <i>negative</i>
religion—such is the Protestant without a certain creed; and
at the same time to deny those privileges to men whom we know
to agree to an iota in every one <i>positive</i> doctrine, which all of us,
who profess religion authoritatively taught in England, hold ourselves,
according to our faculties, bound to believe.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not purely an argument from definition, but it contains
such an argument, and so contrasts with his dominant position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
on a subject which engaged much of his thought and seems to
have filled him with sincere feeling.</p>

<p>We shall examine him now on another major subject to
engage his statesmanship, the rebellion of the North American
Colonies against Great Britain. By common admission today,
Burke’s masterpiece of forensic eloquence is the speech moving
his resolutions for conciliation with that disaffected part
of the Empire, delivered in the House of Commons on March
22, 1775. In admiring the felicities with which this great oration
undoubtedly abounds, it is easy to overlook the fact that
it is from beginning to end an argument from circumstance.
It is not an argument about rights or definitions, as Burke explicitly
says at two or three points; it is an argument about
policy as dictated by circumstances. Its burden is a plea to
conciliate the colonies because they are waxing great. No
subtlety of interpretation is required to establish this truth,
because we can substantially establish it in the express language
of Burke himself.</p>

<p>To see the aspect of this argument, it is useful to begin by
looking at the large alternatives which the orator enumerates
for Parliament in the exigency. The first of these is to change
the spirit of the Colonies by rendering it more submissive.
Circumventing the theory of the relationship of ruler and
ruled, Burke sets aside this alternative as impractical. He admits
that an effort to bring about submission would be “radical
in its principle” (<i>i.e.</i>, would have a root in principle); but he
sees too many obstacles in geography, ethnology, and other
circumstances to warrant the trial.</p>

<p>The second alternative is to prosecute the Colonists as criminal.
At this point, the “magnitude of the object” again enters
his equation, and he would distinguish between the indictment
of a single individual and the indictment of a whole
people as things different in kind. The number and vigor of
the Americans constitute an embarrassing circumstance.
Therefore his thought issues in the oft-quoted statement “I do
not know the method of drawing up an indictment against a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
whole people.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This was said, it should be recalled, despite
the fact that history is replete with proceedings against rebellious
subjects.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But Burke had been an agent for the colony
of New York; he had studied the geography and history of the
Colonies with his usual industry; and we may suppose him to
have had a much clearer idea than his colleagues in Parliament
of their power to support a conflict.</p>

<p>It is understandable, by this view, that his third alternative
should be “to comply with the American spirit as necessary.”
He told his fellow Commoners plainly that his proposal had
nothing to do with the legal right of taxation. “My consideration
is narrow, confined, and wholly limited to the policy of
the question.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This policy he later characterizes as “systematic
indulgence.” The outcome of this disjunctive argument
is then a measure to accommodate a circumstance. The circumstance
is that America is a growing country, of awesome
potentiality, whose strength, both actual and imminent, makes
it advisable for the Mother Country to overlook abstract
rights. In a peroration, the topic of abstract rights is assigned
to those “vulgar and mechanical politicians,” who are “not fit
to turn a wheel in the machine” of Empire.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>With this conclusion in mind, it will be instructive to see
how the orator prepared the way for his proposal. The entire
first part of his discourse may be described as a depiction of
the circumstance which is to be his source of argument. After
a circumspect beginning, in which he calls attention to the
signs of rebellion and derides the notion of “paper government,”
he devotes a long and brilliant passage to simple characterization
of the Colonies and their inhabitants. The unavoidable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
effect of this passage is to impress upon his hearers
the size and resources of this portion of the Empire. First he
takes up the rapidly growing population, then the extensive
trade, then the spirit of enterprise, and finally the personal
character of the Colonists themselves. Outstanding even in
this colorful passage is his account of the New England whaling
industry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice,
and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of
Hudson’s Bay and Davis’s Straits, whilst we are looking for them
beneath the Arctic Circle, we hear that they have pierced into the
opposite region of polar cold, that they are at the antipodes, and
engaged under the frozen Serpent of the South. Falkland Island,
which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of
national ambition, is but a stage and resting-place in the progress
of their victorious industry. Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
to them than the accumulated winter of both the poles.
We know that whilst some of them draw the line and strike the
harpoon on the coast of Africa, others run the longitude and pursue
their gigantic game along the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is
vexed by their fisheries; no climate that is not witness to their toils.
Neither the perseverance of Holland, nor the activity of France,
nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of English enterprise ever
carried this most perilous mode of hard industry to the extent to
which it has been pushed by this recent people; a people who are
still, as it were, but in the gristle; and not yet hardened into the
bone of manhood.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is the spectacle of this enterprise which induces Burke to
“pardon something to the spirit of liberty.”</p>

<p>The long recital is closed with an appeal which may be fitly
regarded as the <i>locus classicus</i> of the argument from circumstance.
For with this impressive review of the fierce spirit of
the colonists before his audience, Burke declares: “The question
is, not whether the spirit deserves praise or blame, but—what,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
in the name of God, shall we do with it?”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The question
then is not what is right or wrong, or what accords with our
idea of justice or our scheme of duty; it is, how can we meet
this circumstance? “I am not determining a point of law; I
am restoring tranquillity.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The circumstance becomes the
cue of the policy. We must remind ourselves that our concern
here is not to pass upon the merits of a particular controversy,
but to note the term which Burke evidently considered most
efficacious in moving his hearers. “Political reason,” he says,
elsewhere, “is a computing principle.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Where does political
reason in this instance leave him? It leaves him inevitably in
the middle, keeping the Colonies, but not as taxable parts of
the Empire, allowing them to pay their own charge by voluntary
grants. In Burke’s characteristic view, the theoretic relationship
has been altered by the medium until the thirteen (by
his count fourteen) colonies of British North America are left
halfway between colonial and national status. The position of
the Tories meant that either the Colonies would be colonies or
they would terminate their relationship with the Empire.
Burke’s case was that by concession to circumstance they
could be retained in some form, and this would be a victory
for policy. Philosophers of starker principle, like Tom Paine,
held that a compromise of the Burkean type would have been
unacceptable in the long run even to the Americans, and the
subsequent crystallization of American nationality seems to
support this view. But Burke thought he saw a way to preserve
an institution by making way for a large corporeal fact.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Burke’s interest in the affairs of
India, and more specifically in the conduct of the East India
Company, is not reconcilable in quite the same way with the
thesis of this chapter. Certainly there is nothing in mean motives
or contracted views to explain why he should have labored
over a period of fourteen years to benefit a people with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
whom he had no contact and from whom he could expect no
direct token of appreciation. But it must be emphasized that
the subject of this essay is methods, and even in this famous
case Burke found some opportunity to utilize his favorite
source.</p>

<p>In 1783, years before the impeachment of Warren Hastings,
he made a long speech in Parliament attacking Fox’s East
India Bill. He was by then deeply impressed by the wrongs
done the Indians by British adventurers, yet it will be observed
that his <i>habitus</i> reveals itself in the following passages.
He said of the East India Company:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I do not presume to condemn those who argue <i>a priori</i> against
the propriety of leaving such extensive political power in the hands
of a company of merchants. I know much is, and much more may
be, said against such a system. But, with my particular ideas and
sentiments, I cannot go that way to work. I feel an insuperable
reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution
of government, upon a theory, however plausible it may be.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then shortly he continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To justify us in taking the administration of their affairs out of
the hands of the East India Company, as my principles, I must see
several conditions. 1st, the object affected by the abuse must be
great and important. 2nd, the abuse affecting the great object
ought to be a great abuse. 3rd, it ought to be habitual and not accidental.
4th, it ought to be utterly incurable in the body as it now
stands constituted.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is pertinent to observe that Burke’s first condition here is
exactly the first condition raised with reference to the Irish
Catholics and with reference to the American Colonies. It is
further characteristic of his method that the passages cited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
above are followed immediately by a description of the extent
and wealth and civilization of India, just as the plea for approaching
the Colonies with reconciliation was followed by a
vivid advertisement of their extent and wealth and enterprise.
The argument is for justice, but it is conditioned upon a circumstance.</p>

<p>When Burke undertook the prosecution of Hastings in 1788,
these considerations seemed far from his mind. The splendid
opening charge contains arguments strictly from genus, despite
the renunciation of such arguments which we see above.
He attacked the charter of the East India Company by showing
that it violated the idea of a charter.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He affirmed the
natural rights of man, and held that they had been criminally
denied in India.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He scorned the notion of geographical
morality. These sound like the utterances of a man committed
to abstract right. Lord Morley has some observations on Burke
which may contain the explanation. His study of Burke’s career
led him to feel that “direct moral or philanthropic apostleship
was not his function.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Of his interest in India, he remarked:
“It was reverence rather than sensibility, a noble and
philosophic conservatism rather than philanthropy, which
raised the storm in Burke’s breast against the rapacity of English
adventurers in India, and the imperial crimes of Hastings.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
If it is true that Burke acted out of reverence rather
than out of sensibility or philanthropy, what was the reverence
of? It was, likely, for storied India, for an ancient and
opulent civilization which had brought religion and the arts
to a high point of development while his ancestors were yet
“in the woods.” There is just enough of deference for the established
and going concern, for panoply, for that which has
prestige, to make us feel that Burke was again impressed—with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
an intended consequence which was noble, of course;
but it is only fair to record this component of the situation.</p>

<p>The noble and philosophic conservatism next translated
itself into a violent opposition to the French Revolution, which
was threatening to bring down a still greater structure of
rights and dignities, though in this instance in the name of
reform and emancipation.</p>

<p>The French Revolution was the touchstone of Burke. Those
who have regarded his position on this event as a reversal, or
a sign of fatigue and senescence, have not sufficiently analyzed
his methods and his sources. Burke would have had to become
a new man to take any other stand than he did on the French
Revolution. It was an event perfectly suited to mark off those
who argue from circumstance, for it was one of the most radical
revolutions on record, and it was the work of a people fond
of logical rigor and clear demonstration.</p>

<p>Why Burke, who had championed the Irish Catholics, the
American colonists, and the Indians should have championed
on this occasion the nobility and the propertied classes of
Europe is easy to explain. For him Europe, with all its settlements
and usages, was the circumstance; and the Revolution
was the challenge to it. From first to last Burke saw the grand
upheaval as a contest between inherited condition and speculative
insight. The circumstance said that Europe should go
on; the Revolution said that it should cease and begin anew.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Burke’s position was not selfish; it was prudential within the
philosophy we have seen him to hold.</p>

<p>Actually his <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> divides
itself into two parts. The first is an attempt, made with
a zeal which seems almost excessive, to prove that the British
government was the product of slow accretion of precedent,
that it is for that reason a beneficent and stable government,
and that the British have renounced, through their choice of
methods in the past, any theoretical right to change their government
by revolution. The second part is a miscellany of
remarks on the proceedings in France, in which many shrewd
observations of human nature are mingled with eloquent
appeals on behalf of the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p>Burke appears terrified by the thought that the ultimate
sources and sanctions of government should be brought out
into broad daylight for the inspection of everyone, and the
first effort was to clothe the British government with a kind of
concealment against this sort of inspection, which could, of
course, result in the testing of that government by what might
have been or might yet be. The second effort was to show
that France, instead of embarking on a career of progress
through her daring revolution, “had abandoned her interest,
that she might prostitute her virtue.” It will be observed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in both of these, a presumed well-being is the source of his
argument. Therefore we have the familiar recourse to concrete
situation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Circumstances (which with some gentlemen, pass for nothing)
give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color
and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what render
every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind.
Abstractedly speaking, government, as well as liberty, is good; yet
could I, in common sense, ten years ago, have felicitated France
upon her enjoyment of a government (for she then had a government)
without inquiring what the nature of the government was,
or how it was administered? Can I now congratulate the same nation
on its freedom?<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In his <i>Letter to a Member of the National Assembly</i> (1791)
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What a number of faults have led to this multitude of misfortunes,
and almost all from this one source—that of considering
certain general maxims, without attending to circumstances, to
times, to places, to conjectures, and to actors! If we do not attend
scrupulously to all of these, the medicine of today becomes the
poison of tomorrow.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was the gist of such advice as Burke had for the French.
That they should build on what they had instead of attempting
to found <i>de novo</i>, that they should adapt necessary changes
to existing conditions, and above all that they should not
sacrifice the sources of dignity and continuity in the state—these
made up a sort of gospel of precedent and gradualism
which he preached to the deaf ears across the Channel. We
behold him here in his characteristic political position, but
forced to dig a little deeper, to give his theorems a more general
application, and, it is hardly unjust to say, to make what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
really constitutes a denial of philosophy take on some semblance
of philosophy. Yet Burke was certainly never at a
greater height rhetorically in defending a reigning circumstance.
Let us listen to him for a moment on the virtues of
old Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists,
and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished
forever. Never, never more shall we behold that generous
loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience,
the subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in servitude
itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of
life, the cheap defense of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment, is
gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour,
which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it
mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under
which vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its grossness.</p>

<p>This mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in
the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied in its appearance
by the varying state of human affairs, subsisted and influenced
through a long succession of generations, even to the time
we live in. If it should ever be totally extinguished, the loss I fear
will be great. It is this which has given its character to modern
Europe. It is this which has distinguished it under all its forms of
government, and distinguished it to its advantage, from the states
of Asia, and possibly from those states which flourished in the most
brilliant periods of the antique world. It was this, which, without
confounding ranks, has produced a noble equality and handed it
down through all the gradations of social life. It was this opinion
which mitigated kings into companions, and raised private men
to be fellows with kings. Without force or opposition, it subdued
the fierceness of pride and power; it obliged sovereigns to submit
to the soft collar of social esteem, compelled stern authority to
submit to elegance, and gave a dominating vanquisher of laws to
be subdued by manners.</p>

<p>But now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions which
made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the
different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation, incorporated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
into politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private
society, are to be dissolved by the new conquering empire of
light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn
off. All the superadded ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a
moral imagination, which the heart owns and the imagination ratifies,
as necessary to cover the defects of our naked, shivering nature,
and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation, are to be
exposed as ridiculous, absurd, and antiquated fashions.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With the writings on French affairs, Burke’s argument from
circumstance came full flower.</p>

<p>These citations are enough to show a partiality toward
argument of this aspect. But a rehearsal of his general observations
on politics and administration will show it in even
clearer light. Burke had an obsessive dislike of metaphysics
and the methods of the metaphysician. There is scarcely a
peroration or passage of appeal in his works which does not
contain a gibe, direct or indirect, at this subject. In the <i>Speech
On American Taxation</i> he said, “I do not enter into these metaphysical
distinctions; I hate the very sound of them.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This
science he regarded as wholly incompatible with politics, yet
capable of deluding a certain type of politician with its niceties
and exactitudes. Whenever Burke introduced the subject
of metaphysics, he was in effect arguing from contraries; that
is to say, he was asserting that what is metaphysically true is
politically false or unfeasible. For him, metaphysical clarity
was at the opposite pole from political prudence. As he observed
in the <i>Reflections</i>, “The pretended rights of these theories
are all extremes; and in proportion as they are metaphysically
true, they are morally and politically false.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In
the first letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe, he ridiculed “the
metaphysicians of our times, who are the most foolish of men,
and who, dealing in universals and essences, see no difference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
between more and less.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It will be noted that this last is a
philosophical justification for his regular practice of weighing
a principle by the scale of magnitude of situation. The “more
and less” thus becomes determinative of the good. “Metaphysics
cannot live without definition, but prudence is cautious
how she defines,”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> he said in the <i>Appeal from the New to the
Old Whigs</i>. And again in the <i>Reflections</i>, “These metaphysic
rights, entering into common life, like rays of light which
pierce into a dense medium are by the laws of nature refracted
from a straight line. Indeed, in the gross and complicated mass
of human passions and concerns, the primitive rights of man
undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it
becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the
simplicity of their original direction.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Finally, there is his
clear confession, “Whenever I speak against a theory, I mean
always a weak, erroneous, fallacious, unfounded theory, and
one of the ways of discovering that it is a false theory is by
comparing it with practice.” This is the philosophical explanation
of the source in circumstance of Burke’s characteristic
argument.</p>

<p>In a brilliant passage on the American character, he had
observed that the Americans were in the habit of judging the
pressure of a grievance by the badness of the principle rather
than <i>vice versa</i>. Burke’s own habit, we now see, was fairly
consistently the reverse: he judged the badness of the principle
by the pressure of the grievance; and hence we are compelled
to suppose that he believed politics ought to be decided
empirically and not dialectically. Yet a consequence of this
position is that whoever says he is going to give equal consideration
to circumstance and to ideals (or principles) almost
inevitably finds himself following circumstances while preserving
a mere decorous respect for ideals.</p>

<p>Burke’s doctrine of precedent, which constitutes a central<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
part of his political thought, is directly related with the above
position. If one is unwilling to define political aims with reference
to philosophic absolutes, one tries to find guidance in
precedent. We have now seen that a principal topic of the
<i>Reflections</i> is a defense of custom against insight. Burke tried
with all his eloquence to show that the “manly” freedom of the
English was something inherited from ancestors, like a valuable
piece of property, increased or otherwise modified slightly
to meet the needs of the present generation, and then reverently
passed on. He did not want to know the precise origin
of the title to it, nor did he want philosophical definition of it.
In fact, the statement of Burke which so angered Thomas
Paine—that Englishmen were ready to take up arms to prove
that they had no right to change their government—however
brash or paradoxical seeming, was quite in keeping with such
conviction. Since he scorned that freedom which did not have
the stamp of generations of approval upon it, he attempted to
show that freedom too was a matter of precedent.</p>

<p>Yet this is an evasion rather than an answer to the real question
which is lying in wait for Burke’s political philosophy.
It is essential to see that government either moves with something
in view or it does not, and to say that people may be
governed merely by following precedent begs the question.
What line do the precedents mark out for us? How may we
know that this particular act is in conformity with the body of
precedents unless we can abstract the essence of the precedents?
And if one extracts the essence of a body of precedents,
does not one have a “speculative idea”? However one turns,
one cannot evade the truth that there is no practice without
theory, and no government without some science of government.
Burke’s statement that a man’s situation is the preceptor
of his duty cannot be taken seriously unless one can isolate
the precept.</p>

<p>This dilemma grows out of Burke’s own reluctance to speculate
about the origin and ultimate end of government. “There
is a sacred veil to be drawn over the beginnings of all governments,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
he declared in his second day’s speech at the trial of
Warren Hastings.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> To the abstract doctrines of the French
Revolution, he responded with a “philosophic analogy,” by
which governments are made to come into being with something
like the indistinct remoteness of the animal organism.
This political organism is a “mysterious incorporation,” never
wholly young or middle-aged or old, but partly each at every
period, and capable, like the animal organism, of regenerating
itself through renewal of tissue. It is therefore modified only
through the slow forces that produce evolution. But to the
question of what brings on the changes in society, Burke was
never able to give an answer. He had faced the problem briefly
in the <i>Tract on the Popery Laws</i>, where he wrote: “Is, then, no
improvement to be brought into society? Undoubtedly, but
not by compulsion—but by encouragement, but by countenance,
favor, privileges, which are powerful and are lawful
instruments.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> These, however, are the passive forces which
admit change, not the active ones which initiate it. The prime
mover is still to seek. If such social changes are brought about
by immanent evolutionary forces, they are hardly voluntary;
if on the other hand they are voluntary, they must be identifiable
with some point in time and with some agency of initiation.
It quickly becomes obvious that if one is to talk about
the beginnings of things, about the nisus of growth or of accumulation
of precedents, and about final ends, one must
shift from empirical to speculative ground. Burke’s attachment
to what was <i>de facto</i> prevented him from doing this in
political theory and made him a pleader from circumstance
at many crucial points in his speeches. One can scarcely do better
than quote the judgment of Sir James Prior in his summation
of Burke’s career: “His aim therefore in our domestic
policy, was to preserve all our institutions in the main as they
stood for the simple reason that under them the nation had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
become great, and prosperous, and happy.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This is but a generalized
translation of the position “If it exists, there is something
to be said in its favor,” which we have determined as the
aspect of the great orator’s case.</p>

<p>That position is, moreover, the essential position of Whiggism
as a political philosophy. It turns out to be, on examination,
a position which is defined by other positions because
it will not conceive ultimate goals, and it will not display on
occasion a sovereign contempt for circumstances as radical
parties of both right and left are capable of doing. The other
parties take their bearing from some philosophy of man and
society; the Whigs take their bearings from the other parties.
Whatever a party of left or right proposes, they propose (or
oppose) in tempered measure. Its politics is then cautionary,
instinctive, trusting more to safety and to present success than
to imagination and dramatic boldness of principle. It is, to
make the estimate candid, a politics without vision and consequently
without the capacity to survive.</p>

<p>“The political parties which I call great,” Tocqueville wrote
in <i>Democracy in America</i>, “are those which cling to principles
rather than to their consequences, to general and not
to special cases, to ideas and not to men.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Manifestly the
Whig Party is contrary to this on each point. The Whigs do
not argue from principles (<i>i.e.</i>, genera and definitions); they
are awed not merely by consequences but also by circumstances;
and as for the general and the special, we have now
heard Burke testify on a dozen occasions to his disregard of
the former and his veneration of the latter. There is indeed
ground for saying that Burke was more Whig than the British
Whigs of his own day themselves, because at the one time
when the British Whig Party took a turn in the direction of
radical principle, Burke found himself out of sympathy with
it and, before long, was excluded from it. This occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
1791, when the electrifying influence of the French Revolution
produced among the liberals of the age a strong trend
toward the philosophic left. It was this trend which drew
from Burke the <i>Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs</i>, with
its final scornful paragraph in which he refused to take his
principles “from a French die.” This writing was largely taken
up with a defense of his recently published <i>Reflections on the
Revolution in France</i>, and it is here relevant to note how
Burke defines his doctrine as a middle course. “The opinions
maintained in that book,” he said, “never can lead to an extreme,
because their foundation is laid in an opposition to
extremes.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> “These doctrines do of themselves gravitate to a
middle point, or to some point near a middle.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> “The author of
that book is supposed to have passed from extreme to extreme;
but he has always actually kept himself in a medium.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Actually the course of events which caused this separation
was the same as that which led to the ultimate extinction of
the Whig point of view in British political life. In the early
twentieth century, when a world conflict involving the Empire
demanded of parties a profound basis in principle, the heirs
of the Whig party passed from the scene, leaving two coherent
parties, one of the right and one of the left. That is part of our
evidence for saying that a party which bases itself upon circumstance
cannot outlast that circumstance very long; that its
claim to make smaller mistakes (and to have smaller triumphs)
than the extreme parties will not win it enduring
allegiance; and that when the necessity arises, as it always
does at some time, to look at the foundations of the commonwealth,
Burke’s wish will be disregarded, and only deeply
founded theories will be held worthy. A party does not become
great by feasting on the leavings of other parties, and
Whiggism’s bid for even temporary success is often rejected.
A party must have its own principle of movement and must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
not be content to serve as a brake on the movements of others.
Thus there is indication that Whiggism is a recipe for political
failure, but before affirming this as a conclusion, let us extend
our examination further to see how other parties have fared
with circumstance as the decisive argument.</p>

<p>The American Whig Party showed all the defects of this
position in an arena where such defects were bound to be more
promptly fatal. It is just to say that this party never had a set
of principles. Lineal descendants of the old Federalists, the
American Whigs were simply the party of opposition to that
militant democracy which received its most aggressive leadership
from Andrew Jackson. It was, generally speaking, the
party of the “best people”; that is to say, the people who
showed the greatest respect for industry and integrity, the
people in whose eyes Jackson was “that wicked man and vulgar
hero.” Yet because it had no philosophical position, it was
bound to take its position from that of the other party, as we
have seen that Whiggism is doomed to do. During most of its
short life it was conspicuously a party of “outs” arrayed against
“ins.”</p>

<p>It revealed the characteristic impotence in two obvious
ways. First, it pinned its hopes for victory on brilliant personalities
rather than on dialectically secured positions. Clay,
Webster, and Calhoun, who between them represented the
best statesmanship of the generation, were among its leaders,
but none of them ever reached the White House. The beau
ideal of the party was Clay, whose title “the Great Compromiser”
seems to mark him as the archetypal Whig. Finally it
discovered a politically “practical” candidate in William
Henry Harrison, soldier and Indian fighter, and through a
campaign of noise and irrelevancies, put him in the Presidency.
But this success was short, and before long the Whigs
were back battling under their native handicaps.</p>

<p>Second, frustrated by its series of reverses, it decided that
what the patient needed was more of the disease. Whereas at
the beginning it had been only relatively pragmatic in program<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and had preserved dignity in method, it now resolved to
become completely pragmatic in program and as pragmatic
as its rivals the Democrats in method. Of the latter step, the
“coonskin and hard-cider” campaign on behalf of Harrison
was the proof. We may cite as special evidence the advice
given to Harrison’s campaign manager by Nicholas Biddle of
Philadelphia. “Let him [the candidate] say not a single word
about his principles or his creed—let him say nothing, promise
nothing. Let the use of pen and ink be wholly forbidden.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> E.
Malcolm Carroll in his <i>Origins of the Whig Party</i> has thus
summed up the policy of the Whig leaders after their round
with Jackson: “The most active of the Whig politicians and
editors after 1836, men like Weed, Greeley, Ewing of Ohio,
Thaddeus Stevens, and Richard Houghton of Boston, preferred
success to a consistent position and, therefore, influenced
the party to make its campaign in the form of appeal
to popular emotion and, for this purpose, to copy the methods
of the Democratic Party.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This verdict is supported by Paul
Murray in his study of Whig operations in Georgia: “The compelling
aim of the party was to get control of the existing
machinery of government, to maintain that control, and, in
some cases, to change the form of government the better to
serve the dominant interest of the group.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Murray found
that the Whigs of Georgia “naturally had a respect for the past
that approached at times the unreasonable reverence of Edmund
Burke for eighteenth century political institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But a party whose only program is an endorsement of the
<i>status quo</i> is destined to go to pieces whenever the course of
events brings a principle strongly to the fore. The American
Union was moving toward a civil conflict in which ideological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
differences, as deep as any that have appeared in modern
revolutions, were to divide men. As always occurs in such
crises, the compromisers are regarded as unreliable by both
sides and are soon ejected from the scene. It now seems impossible
that the Whig Party, with its political history, could
have survived the fifties. But the interesting fact from the
standpoint of theoretical discussion is that the Democratic
Party, because it was a radically based party, was able to take
over and defend certain of the defensible earlier Whig positions.
Murray points out the paradoxical fact that the Democratic
Party “purloined the leadership of conservative property
interests in Georgia and the South.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is no less paradoxical
that it should have purloined the defense of the states’ rights
doctrine thirty years after Jackson had threatened to hang
disunionists.</p>

<p>The paradox can be resolved only by seeing that the Whig
position was one of self-stultification; and this is why a rising
young political leader in Illinois of Whig affiliation left the
party to lead a re-conceived Republican Party. The evidence
of Lincoln’s life greatly favors the supposition that he was a
conservative. But he saw that conservatism to be politically
effective cannot be Whiggism, that it cannot perpetually argue
from circumstance. He saw that to be politically effective conservatism
must have something more than a temperamental
love of quietude or a relish for success. It must have some
ideal objective. He found objectives in the moral idea of freedom
and the political idea of union.</p>

<p>The political party which Abraham Lincoln carried to victory
in 1860 was a party with these moral objectives. The
Whigs had disintegrated from their own lack of principle, and
the Republicans emerged with a program capable of rallying
men to effort and sacrifice—which are in the long run psychologically
more compelling than the stasis of security. But after
the war and the death of the party’s unique leader, all moral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
idealism speedily fell away.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Of the passion of revenge there
was more than enough, so that some of the victor’s measures
look like the measures of a radical party. But the elevation of
Grant to the presidency and the party’s conduct during and
after the Gilded Age show clearly the declining interest in
reform. Before the end of the century the Republican Party
had been reduced in its source of appeal to the Whig argument
from circumstance (or in the case of the tariff to a wholly
dishonest argument from consequences). For thirty or forty
years its case came to little more than this: we are the richest
nation on earth with the most widely distributed prosperity;
therefore this party advocates the <i>status quo</i>. The argument,
whether embodied in the phrase “the full dinner pail” or “two
cars in every garage” has the same source. Murray’s judgment
of the Whig party in Georgia a hundred years ago: “Many
facts in the history of the party might impel one to say that its
members regarded the promotion of prosperity as the supreme
aim of government,”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> can be applied without the slightest
change to the Republican Party of the 1920’s. But when the
circumstance of this <i>status quo</i> disappeared about 1930, the
party’s source of argument disappeared too, and no other has
been found since. It became the party of frustration and hatred,
and like the Whig Party earlier, it clung to personalities
in the hope that they would be sufficient to carry it to victory.
First there was the grass roots Middle Westerner Alf Landon;
then the glamorous new convert to internationalism Wendell
Willkie; then the gang-buster and Empire State governor
Thomas Dewey. Finally, to make the parallel complete, there
came the military hero General Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower
can be called the William Henry Harrison of the Republican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Party. He is “against” what the Democrats are doing,
and he is admired by the “best” people. All this is well suited
to take minds off real issues through an outpouring of national
vanity and the enjoyment of sensation.</p>

<p>The Republican charge against the incumbent administration
has been consistently the charge of “bungling,” while
those Republicans who have based their dissent on something
more profound and clear-sighted have generally drawn the
suspicion and disapproval of the party’s supposedly practical
leaders. Of this the outstanding proof is the defeat of the leadership
of Taft. To look at the whole matter in an historical
frame of reference, there has been so violent a swing toward
the left that the Democrats today occupy the position once
occupied by the Socialists; and the Republicans, having to
take their bearings from this, now occupy the center position,
which is historically reserved for liberals. Their series of defeats
comes from a failure to see that there is an intellectually
defensible position on the right. They persist with the argument
from circumstance, which never wins any major issues,
and sometimes, as we have noted, they are left without the
circumstance.</p>

<p>I shall suggest that this story has more than an academic
interest for an age which has seen parliamentary government
exposed to insults, some open and vicious, some concealed and
insidious. There are in existence many technological factors
which themselves constitute an argument from circumstance
for one-party political rule. Indeed, if the trend of circumstances
were our master term, we should almost certainly have
to favor the one-party efficiency system lately flourishing in
Europe. The centralization of power, the technification of
means of communication, the extreme peril of political divisiveness
in the face of modern weapons of war, all combine to
put the question, “What is the function of a party of opposition
in this streamlined world anyhow?” Its proper function
is to talk, but talking, unless it concerns some opposition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
principles, is but the wearisome contention of “ins” and “outs.”
Democracy is a dialectical process, and unless society can
produce a group sufficiently indifferent to success to oppose
the ruling group on principle rather than according to opportunity
for success, the idea of opposition becomes discredited.
A party which can argue only from success has no rhetorical
topic against the party presently enjoying success.</p>

<p>The proper aim of a political party is to persuade, and to
persuade it must have a rhetoric. As far as mere methods go,
there is nothing to object to in the argument from circumstance,
for undeniably it has a power to move. Yet it has this
power through a widely shared human weakness, which turns
out on examination to be shortsightedness. This shortsightedness
leads a party to positions where it has no policy, or only
the policy of opposing an incumbent. When all the criteria are
brought to bear, then, this is an inferior source of argument,
which reflects adversely upon any habitual user and generally
punishes with failure. Since, as we have seen, it is grounded
in the nature of a situation rather than in the nature of things,
its opposition will not be a dialectically opposed opposition,
any more than was Burke’s opposition to the French Revolution.
And here, in substance, I would say, is the great reason
why Burke should not be taken as prophet by the political
conservatives. True, he has left many wonderful materials
which they should assimilate. His insights into human nature
are quite solid propositions to build with, and his eloquence
is a lesson for all time in the effective power of energy and
imagery. Yet these are the auxiliary rhetorical appeals. For
the rhetorical appeal on which it will stake its life, a cause must
have some primary source of argument which will not be embarrassed
by abstractions or even by absolutes—the general
ideas mentioned by Tocqueville. Burke was magnificent at
embellishment, but of clear rational principle he had a mortal
distrust. It could almost be said that he raised “muddling
through” to the height of a science, though in actuality it can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
never be a science. In the most critical undertaking of all, the
choice of one’s source of argument, it would be blindness to
take him as mentor. To find what Burke lacked, we now turn
to the American Abraham Lincoln, who despite an imperfect
education, discovered that political arguments must ultimately
be based on genus or definition.</p>

ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE ARGUMENT FROM DEFINITION</h2>

</div>

<p>Although most readers of Lincoln sense the prevailing
aspect of his arguments, there has been no thoughtful
treatment of this interesting subject. Albert Beveridge
merely alludes to it in his observation that “In trials in circuit
courts Lincoln depended but little on precedents; he
argued largely from first principles.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Nicolay and Hay, in
describing Lincoln’s speech before the Republican Banquet
in Chicago, December 10, 1856, report as follows: “Though
these fragments of addresses give us only an imperfect reflection
of the style of Mr. Lincoln’s oratory during this period,
they nevertheless show its essential characteristics, a pervading
clearness of analysis, and that strong tendency toward
axiomatic definition which gives so many of his sentences their
convincing force and durable value.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> W. H. Herndon, who
had the opportunity of closest personal observation, was perhaps
the most analytical of all when he wrote: “Not only were
nature, man, and principle suggestive to Mr. Lincoln; not only
had he accurate and exact perceptions, but he was causative;
his mind apparently with an automatic movement, ran back
behind facts, principles, and all things to their origin and first
cause—to the point where forces act at once as effect and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
cause.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> He observed further in connection with Lincoln’s
practice before the bar: “All opponents dreaded his originality,
his condensation, definition, and force of expression....”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Our feeling that he is a father of the nation even more convincingly
than Washington, and that his words are words of
wisdom when compared with those of the more intellectual
Jefferson and the more academic Wilson strengthen the supposition
that he argued from some very fundamental source.
And when we find opinion on the point harmonious, despite
the wide variety of description his character has undergone,
we have enough initial confirmation to go forward with the
study—a study which is important not alone as showing the
man in clearer light but also as showing upon what terms conservatism
is possible.</p>

<p>It may be useful to review briefly the argument from definition.
The argument from definition, in the sense we shall
employ here, includes all arguments from the nature of the
thing. Whether the genus is an already recognized convention,
or whether it is defined at the moment by the orator, or
whether it is left to be inferred from the aggregate of its species,
the argument has a single postulate. The postulate is that
there exist classes which are determinate and therefore predicable.
In the ancient proposition of the schoolroom, “Socrates
is mortal,” the class of mortal beings is invoked as a
predicable. Whatever is a member of the class will accordingly
have the class attributes. This might seem a very easy admission
to gain, but it is not so from those who believe that genera
are only figments of the imagination and have no self-subsistence.
Such persons hold, in the extreme application of their
doctrine, that all deduction is unwarranted assumption; or
that attributes cannot be transferred by imputation from
genus to species. The issue here is very deep, going back to
the immemorial quarrel over universals, and we shall not here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
explore it further than to say that the argument from definition
or genus involves a philosophy of being, which has divided
and probably will continue to divide mankind. There are those
who seem to feel that genera are imprisoning bonds which
serve only to hold the mind in confinement. To others, such
genera appear the very organon of truth. Without going into
that question here, it seems safe to assert that those who believe
in the validity of the argument from genus are idealists,
roughly, if not very philosophically, defined. The evidence
that Lincoln held such belief is overwhelming; it characterizes
his thinking from an early age; and the greatest of his utterances
(excepting the Gettysburg Address, which is based
upon similitude) are chiefly arguments from definition.</p>

<p>In most of the questions which concerned him from the time
he was a struggling young lawyer until the time when he was
charged with the guidance of the nation, Lincoln saw opportunity
to argue from the nature of man. In fact, not since the
Federalist papers of James Madison had there been in American
political life such candid recourse to this term. I shall
treat his use of it under the two heads of argument from a
concept of human nature and argument from a definition of
man.</p>

<p>Lincoln came early to the conclusion that human nature is
a fixed and knowable thing. Many of his early judgments of
policy are based on a theory of what the human being <i>qua</i>
human being will do in a given situation. Whether he had
arrived at this concept through inductive study—for which he
had varied opportunity—or through intuition is, of course, not
the question here; our interest is in the reasoning which the
concept made possible. It appears a fact that Lincoln trusted
in a uniform predictability of human nature.</p>

<p>In 1838, when he was only twenty-nine years old, he was
invited to address the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield on
the topic “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.” In
this instance, the young orator read the danger to perpetuation
in the inherent evil of human nature. His argument was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
that the importance of a nation or the sacredness of a political
dogma could not withstand the hunger of men for personal
distinction. Now the founders of the Union had won distinction
through that very role, and so satisfied themselves. But
oncoming men of the same breed would be looking for similar
opportunity for distinction, and possibly would not find it in
tasks of peaceful construction. It seemed to him quite possible
that in the future bold natures would appear who would seek
to gain distinction by pulling down what their predecessors
had erected. To a man of this nature it matters little whether
distinction is won “at the expense of emancipating slaves or
enslaving freemen.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The fact remains that “Distinction will
be his paramount object,” and “nothing left to be done in the
way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling
down.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In this way Lincoln held personal ambition to be distinctive
of human nature, and he was willing to predict it of
his fellow citizens, should their political institutions endure
“fifty times” as long as they had.</p>

<p>Another excellent example of the use of this source appears
in a speech which Lincoln made during the Van Buren administration.
Agitation over the National Bank question was
still lively, and a bill had been put forward which would have
required the depositing of Federal funds in five regional subtreasuries,
rather than in a National Bank, until they were
needed for use. At a political discussion held in the Illinois
House of Representatives, Lincoln made a long speech against
the proposal in which he drew extensively from the topic of
the nature of human nature. His reasoning was that if public
funds are placed in the custody of subtreasurers, the duty and
the personal interest of the custodians may conflict. “And who
that knows anything of human nature doubts that in many
instances interest will prevail over duty, and that the subtreasurer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
will prefer opulent knavery in a foreign land to
honest poverty at home.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> If on the other hand the funds were
placed with a National Bank, which would have the privilege
of using the funds, upon payment of interest, until they are
needed, the duty and interest of the custodian would coincide.
The Bank plan was preferable because we always find the best
performance where duty and self-interest thus run together.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Here we see him basing his case again on the infallible tendency
of human nature to be itself.</p>

<p>A few years later Lincoln was called upon to address the
Washingtonian Temperance Society, which was an organization
of reformed drink addicts. This speech is strikingly independent
in approach, and as such is prophetic of the manner
he was to adopt in wrestling with the great problems of union
and slavery. Instead of following the usual line of the temperance
advocate, with its tone of superiority and condemnation,
he attacked all such approaches as not suited to the nature of
man. He impressed upon his hearers the fact that their problem
was the problem of human nature, “which is God’s decree
and can never be reversed.” He then went on to say that
people with a weakness for drink are not inferior specimens of
the race but have heads and hearts that “will bear advantageous
comparison with those of any other class.” The appeal
to drink addicts was to be addressed to men, and it could not
take the form of denunciation “because it is not much in the
nature of man to be driven to anything; still less to be driven
about that which is exclusively his own business.” When one
seeks to change the conduct of a being of this nature, “persuasion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
kind, unassuming persuasion should ever be adopted.”
He then summed up his point: “Such is man and so must
he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his
own best interests.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>One further instance of this argument may be cited. About
1850 Lincoln compiled notes for an address to young men on
the subject of the profession of law. Here again we find a
refreshingly candid approach, looking without pretense at
the creature man. One piece of advice which Lincoln urged
upon young lawyers was that they never take their whole fee
in advance. To do so would place too great a strain upon
human nature, which would then lack the needful spur to
industry. “When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a
common mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case,
as if something was still in prospect for you, as well as for
your client.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> As in the case of the subtreasury bill, Lincoln
saw the yoking of duty and self-interest as a necessity of our
nature.</p>

<p>These and other passages which could be produced indicate
that he viewed human nature as a constant, by which one
could determine policy without much fear of surprise. Everything
peripheral Lincoln referred to this center. His arguments
consequently were the most fundamental seen since a group
of realists framed the American government with such visible
regard for human passion and weakness. Lincoln’s theory of
human nature was completely unsentimental; it was the creation
of one who had taken many buffetings and who, from
early bitterness and later indifference, never affiliated with
any religious denomination. But it furnished the means of
wisdom and prophecy.</p>

<p>With this habit of reasoning established, Lincoln was ideally
equipped to deal with the great issue of slavery. The American
civil conflict of the last century, when all its superficial excitements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
have been stripped aside, appears another debate
about the nature of man. Yet while other political leaders were
looking to the law, to American history, and to this or that
political contingency, Lincoln looked—as it was his habit already
to do—to the center; that is, to the definition of man.
Was the negro a man or was he not? It can be shown that his
answer to this question never varied, despite willingness to
recognize some temporary and perhaps even some permanent
minority on the part of the African race. The answer was a
clear “Yes,” and he used it on many occasions during the
fifties to impale his opponents.</p>

<p>The South was peculiarly vulnerable to this argument, for
if we look at its position, not through the terms of legal and
religious argument, often ingeniously worked out, but through
its actual treatment of the negro, that position is seen to be
equivocal. To illustrate: in the Southern case he was not a man
as far as the “inalienable rights” go, and the Dred Scott decision
was to class him as a chattel. Yet on the contrary the negro
was very much a man when it came to such matters as understanding
orders, performing work, and, as the presence of the
mulatto testified, helping to procreate the human species. All
of the arguments that the pro-slavery group was able to muster
broke against the stubborn fact, which Lincoln persistently
thrust in their way, that the negro was somehow and in
some degree a man.</p>

<p>For our first examination of this argument, we turn to the
justly celebrated speech at Peoria, October 16, 1854. Lincoln
had actually begun to lose interest in politics when the passage
of the highly controversial Kansas-Nebraska Bill in May, 1854,
reawakened him. It was as if his moral nature had received a
fresh shock from the tendencies present in this bill; and he
began in that year the battle which he waged with remarkable
consistency of position until he won the presidency of the
Union six years later. The Speech at Peoria can be regarded
as the opening gun of this campaign.</p>

<p>The speech itself is a rich study in logic and rhetoric, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
one finds the now mature Lincoln showing his gift for
discovering the essentials of a question. After promising the
audience to confine himself to the “naked merits” of the issue
and to be “no less than national in all the positions” he took,
he turned at once to the topic of domestic slavery. Here arguments
from the genus “man” follow one after another. Lincoln
uses them to confront the Southern people with their dilemma.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Equal justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the
extension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as
you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I
must not object to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this
is perfectly logical, if there is no difference between hogs and
Negroes. But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of
the Negro, I wish to ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have
ever been willing to do as much?<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the Southern people regard the Negro only as an animal,
how do they explain their attitude toward the slave dealer?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You despise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or
even as an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they
may rollick freely with the little Negroes, but not with the slave
dealer’s children. If you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get
through the job without so much as touching him. It is common
with you to join hands with men you meet, but with the slave dealer
you avoid the ceremony—instinctively shrinking from the snaky
contact. If he grows rich and retires from business, you still remember
him, and still keep up the ban of non-intercourse upon him and
his family. Now why is this? You do not so treat the man who deals
in corn, cotton, or tobacco?<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Moreover, if the Negro is merely property, and is incapable
of any sort of classification, what category is there to accommodate
the free Negroes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And yet again. There are in the United States and Territories,
including the District of Columbia, 433,643 free blacks. At five
hundred dollars per head, they are worth over two hundred millions
of dollars. How comes this vast amount of property to be
running about without owners? We do not see free horses or free
cattle running at large. How is this? All these free blacks are the
descendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and they
would be slaves now but for something which has operated on
their white owners, inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to
liberate them. What is that something? Is there any mistaking it? In
all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually
telling you that the poor Negro has some natural right to
himself—that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of
him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The argument is clinched with a passage which puts the
Negro’s case in the most explicit terms one can well conceive
of. “Man” and “self-government,” Lincoln argues, cannot be
defined without respect to one another.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The doctrine of self-government is right—absolutely and eternally
right—but it has no just application as here attempted. Or
perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such application
depends upon whether a Negro is not or is a man. If he is not a
man, in that case he who is a man may as a matter of self-government
do just what he pleases with him.</p>

<p>But if the Negro is a man, is it not to that extent a total destruction
of self-government to say that he too shall not govern himself?
When the white man governs himself, that is self-government;
but when he governs himself and also governs another man, that is
more than self-government—that is despotism. If the Negro is a
man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that “all men are created
equal,” and that there can be no moral right in connection with
one man’s making a slave of another.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>Lincoln knew the type of argument he had to oppose, and
he correctly gauged its force. It was the argument from circumstance,
which he treated as such argument requires to be
treated. “Let us turn slavery from its claims of ‘moral right’
back upon its existing legal rights and its argument of ‘necessity.’”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
He did not deny the “necessity”; he regarded it as
something that could be taken care of in course of time.</p>

<p>After the formation of the Republican Party, he often utilized
his source in definition to point out the salient difference
between Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats were
playing up circumstance (the “necessity” alluded to in the
above quotation) and to consequence (the saving of the Union
through the placating of all sections) while the Republicans
stood, at first a little forlornly, upon principle. As he put it
during a speech at Springfield in 1857:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Republicans inculcate, with whatever of ability they can,
that the Negro is a man, that his bondage is cruelly wrong, and that
the field of his oppression ought not to be enlarged. The Democrats
deny his manhood; deny, or dwarf to insignificance, the wrong of
his bondage; so far as possible crush all sympathy for him, and
cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against him; compliment
themselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call the indefinite
outspreading of his bondage “a sacred right of self-government.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the long contest with Douglas and the party of “popular
sovereignty,” Lincoln’s principal charge was that his opponents,
by straddling issues and through deviousness, were
breaking down the essential definition of man. Repeatedly he
referred to “this gradual and steady debauching of public
opinion.” He made this charge because those who advocated
local option in the matter of slavery were working unremittingly
to change the Negro “from the rank of a man to that of
a brute.” “They are taking him down,” he declared, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and crocodiles,
as Judge Douglas himself expresses it.</p>

<p>“Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important
change? Public opinion in this country is everything. In a
nation like ours this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty
have already wrought a change in the public mind to
the extent I have already stated. There is no man in this crowd
who can contradict it.</p>

<p>“Now, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, I ask you to
note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered
on, layer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal
with the Negro everywhere as with a brute.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We feel that the morality of intellectual integrity lay behind
such resistance to the breaking down of genera. Lincoln realized
that the price of honesty, as well as of success in the long
run, is to stay out of the excluded middle.</p>

<p>In sum, we see that Lincoln could never be dislodged from
his position that there is one genus of human beings; and early
in his career as lawyer he had learned that it is better to base
an argument upon one incontrovertible point than to try to
make an impressive case through a whole array of points.
Through the years he clung tenaciously to this concept of
genus, from which he could draw the proposition that what is
fundamentally true of the family will be true also of the
branches of the family.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Therefore since the Declaration of
Independence had interdicted slavery for man, slavery was
interdicted for the negro in principle. Here is a good place to
point out that whereas for Burke circumstance was often a
deciding factor, for Lincoln it was never more than a retarding
factor. He marked the right to equality affirmed by the signers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of the Declaration of Independence: “They meant simply to
declare the right, so that enforcement of it might follow as
fast as circumstances would permit.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And he recognized the
stubborn fact of the institution of American slavery. But he
did not argue any degree of rightness from the fact. The
strategy of his whole anti-slavery campaign was that slavery
should be restricted to the states in which it then existed and
in this way “put in course of ultimate extinction”—a phrase
which he found expressive enough to use on several occasions.</p>

<p>There is quite possibly concealed here another argument
from definition, expressible in the proposition that which cannot
grow must perish. To fix limits for an institution with the
understanding that it shall never exceed these is in effect to
pass sentence of death. The slavery party seems to have apprehended
early that if slavery could not wax, it would wane, and
hence their support of the Mexican War and the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill. Lincoln’s inflexible defense of the terms of the
old Northwest Ordinance served notice that he represented
the true opposition. In this way his definitive stand drew clear
lines for the approaching conflict.</p>

<p>To gain now a clearer view of Lincoln’s mastery of this
rhetoric, it will be useful to see how he used various arguments
from definition within the scope of a single speech, and for
this purpose we may choose the First Inaugural Address, surely
from the standpoint of topical organization one of the most
notable American state papers. The long political contest, in
which he had displayed acumen along with tenacity, had
ended in victory, and this was the juncture at which he had to
lay down his policy for the American Union. For some men it
would have been an occasion for description mainly; but
Lincoln seems to have taken the advice he had given many
years before to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield: “Passion
has helped us but can do so no more.... Reason, cold,
calculating, unimpassioned reason—must furnish all the materials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
for our future support and defense....”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Without being
cold, the speech is severely logical, and much of the tone is
contributed by the type of argument preferred.</p>

<p>Of the fourteen distinguishable arguments in this address,
eight are arguments from definition or genus. Of the six remaining,
two are from consequences, two from circumstances,
one from contraries, and one from similitude. The proportion
tells its own story. Now let us see how the eight are employed:</p>

<p>1. <i>Argument from the nature of all government.</i> All governments
have a fundamental duty of self-preservation. “Perpetuity
is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all
national governments.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This means of course that whatever
is recognized as a government has the obligation to defend
itself from without and from within, and whatever menaces
the government must be treated as a hostile force. This argument
was offered to meet the contention of the secessionists
that the Constitution nowhere authorized the Federal government
to take forcible measures against the withdrawing
states. Here Lincoln fell back upon the broader genus “all
government.”</p>

<p>2. <i>Argument from the nature of contract.</i> Here Lincoln met
the argument that the association of the states is “in the nature
of a contract merely.” His answer was that the rescinding of a
contract requires the assent of all parties to it. When one party
alone ceases to observe it, the contract is merely violated, and
violation affects the material interests of all parties. By this
interpretation of the law of contract, the Southern states could
not leave the Union without a general consent.</p>

<p>3. <i>Argument from the nature of the American Union.</i> Here
Lincoln began with the proposition that the American Union
is older than the Constitution. Now since the Constitution was
formed “to make a more perfect union,” it must have had in
view the “vital element of perpetuity,” since the omission of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
this element would have left a less perfect union than before.
The intent of the Constitution was that “no State upon its own
mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union.” Therefore the
American Union, as an instrument of government, had in its
legal nature protection against this kind of disintegration.</p>

<p>4. <i>Argument from the nature of the chief magistrate’s office.</i>
Having thus defined the Union, Lincoln next looked at the
duties which its nature imposed upon the chief magistrate.
He defined it as “simple duty” on the chief magistrate’s part to
see that the laws of this unbroken union “be faithfully executed
in all the states.” Obviously the argument was to justify
active measures in defense of the Union. As Lincoln conceived
the definition, it was not the duty of the chief magistrate to
preside over the disintegration of the Union, but to carry on
the executive office just as if no possibility of disintegration
threatened.</p>

<p>Thus far, it will be observed, the speech is a series of deductions,
each one deriving from the preceding definition.</p>

<p>5. <i>Argument from the nature of majority rule.</i> This argument,
with its fine axiomatic statements, was used by Lincoln
to indicate how the government should proceed in cases not
expressly envisaged by the Constitution. Popular government
demands acquiescence by minorities in all such cases. “If the
minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government
will cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing
the government is acquiescence on one side or the other.</p>

<p>“If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin
them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever
a majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The difficulty of the Confederacy with states’ rights within its
own house was to attest to the soundness of this argument.</p>

<p>6. <i>Argument from the nature of the sovereignty of the people.</i>
Here Lincoln conceded the right of the whole people to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
change its government by constitutional reform or by revolutionary
action. But he saw this right vested in the people as a
whole, and he insisted that any change be carried out by the
modes prescribed. The institutions of the country were finally
the creations of the sovereign will of the people. But until a
will on this issue was properly expressed, the government had
a commission to endure as before.</p>

<p>7. <i>Second argument from the nature of the office of chief
magistrate.</i> This argument followed the preceding because
Lincoln had to make it clear that whereas the people, as the
source of sovereign power, had the right to alter or abolish
their government, the chief magistrate, as an elected servant,
had no such right. He was chosen to conduct the government
then in existence. “His duty is to administer the present government
as it came into his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired
by him, to his successor.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>8. <i>Second argument from the nature of the sovereignty of
the people.</i> In this Lincoln reminds his audience that the
American government does not give its officials much power
to do mischief, and that it provides a return of power to the
people at short intervals. In effect, the argument defines the
American type of government and a tyranny as incompatible
from the fact that the governors are up for review by the people
at regular periods.</p>

<p>It can hardly be overlooked that this concentration upon
definition produces a strongly legalistic speech, if we may
conceive law as a process of defining actions. Every important
policy of which explanation is made is referred to some widely
accepted American political theory. It has been said that Lincoln’s
advantage over his opponent Jefferson Davis lay in a
flexible-minded pragmatism capable of dealing with issues
on their own terms, unhampered by metaphysical abstractions.
There may be an element of truth in this if reference is
made to the more confined and superficial matters—to procedural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and administrative detail. But one would go far to find
a speech more respectful toward the established principles of
American government—to defined and agreed upon things—than
the First Inaugural Address.</p>

<p>Although no other speech by Lincoln exhibits so high a proportion
of arguments from definition, the First Message to
Congress (July 4, 1861) makes a noteworthy use of this
source. The withdrawal of still other states from the Union,
the Confederate capture of Fort Sumter, and ensuing military
events compelled Lincoln to develop more fully his anti-secessionist
doctrine. This he did in a passage remarkable for
its treatment of the age-old problem of freedom and authority.
What had to be made determinate, as he saw it, was the nature
of free government.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United
States. It presents to the whole family of man the question of
whether a constitutional republic or democracy—a government of
the people by the same people—can or cannot maintain its territorial
integrity against its own domestic foes. It presents the question
whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control
administration according to organic law in any case, can
always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other
pretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break up their government,
and thus practically put an end to free government upon
the earth. It forces us to ask: “Is there, in all republics, this inherent
and fatal weakness?” “Must a government, of necessity, be too
strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its
own existence?”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then looking at the doctrine of secession as a question of
the whole and its parts, he went on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This relative matter of national power and State rights, as a
principle, is no other than the principle of generality and locality.
Whatever concerns the whole should be confined to the whole—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the General Government; while whatever concerns only the State
should be left exclusively to the State. This is all there is of original
principle about it. Whether the National Constitution in defining
boundaries between the two has applied the principle with exact
accuracy is not to be questioned. We are all bound by that defining
without question.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>One further argument, occurring in a later speech, deserves
special attention because of the clear way in which it reveals
Lincoln’s method. When he delivered his Second Annual Message
to Congress on December 1, 1862, he devoted himself
primarily to the subject of compensated emancipation of the
slaves. This was a critical moment of the war for the people of
the border states, who were not fully committed either way,
and who were sensitive on the subject of slavery. Lincoln
hoped to gain the great political and military advantage of
their adherence. The way in which he approaches the subject
should be of the highest interest to students of rhetoric, for the
opening part of the speech is virtually a copybook exercise in
definition. There he faces the question of what constitutes a
nation. “A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its
people, and its laws.” Here we see in scholarly order the genus
particularized by the differentiae. Next he enters into a critical
discussion of the differentiae. The notion may strike us as
curious, but Lincoln proceeds to cite the territory as the enduring
part. “The territory is the only part which is of a certain
durability. ‘One generation passeth away and another cometh,
but the earth abideth forever.’ It is of the first importance to
duly consider and estimate this ever-enduring part.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Now,
Lincoln goes on to say, our present strife arises “not from our
permanent part, not from the land we inhabit, not from our
national homestead.” It is rather the case that “Our strife pertains
to ourselves—to the passing generations of men; and it
can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
one generation.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The present generation will soon disappear,
and our laws can be modified by our will. Therefore he offers a
plan whereby all owners will be indemnified and all slaves will
be free by the year 1900.</p>

<p>Seen in another way, what Lincoln here does is define “nation”
and then divide the differentiae into the permanent and
the transitory; finally he accommodates his measure both to
the permanent part (a territory to be wholly free after 1900)
and the transitory part (present men and institutions, which
are to be “paid off”).</p>

<p>It is the utterance of an American political leader; yet it is
veritably Scholastic in its method and in the clearness of its
lines of reasoning. It is, at the same time, a fine illustration of
pressing toward the ideal goal while respecting, but not being
deflected by, circumstances.</p>

<p>It seems pertinent to say after the foregoing that one consequence
of Lincoln’s love of definition was a war-time policy
toward slavery which looked to some like temporizing. We
have encountered in an earlier speech his view that the Negro
could not be classified merely as property. Yet it must be remembered
that in the eyes of the law Negro slaves were property;
and Lincoln was, after all, a lawyer. Morally he believed
them not to be property, but legally they were property; and
the necessity of walking a line between the moral imperative
and the law will explain some of his actions which seem not to
agree with the popular conception of the Great Emancipator.
The first serious clash came in the late summer of 1861, when
General Fremont, operating in Missouri, issued a proclamation
freeing all slaves there belonging to citizens in rebellion
against the United States. Lincoln first rebuked General Fremont
and then countermanded his order. To O. H. Browning,
of Quincy, Illinois, who had written him in support of
Fremont’s action, he responded as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You speak of it as the only means of saving the government. On
the contrary, it is itself the surrender of the government. Can it be
pretended that it is any longer the Government of the United
States—any government of constitution and laws—wherein a general
or a president may make permanent rules of property by proclamation?<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was the doctrine of the legal aspect of slavery which was
to be amplified in the Second Annual Message to Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Doubtless some of those who are to pay, and not to receive, will
object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In a certain
sense the liberation of the slaves is the destruction of property—property
acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other
property.... If, then, for a common object this property is to be
sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a common charge?<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is a truism that as a war progresses, the basis of the war
changes, and our civil conflict was no exception. It appears to
have become increasingly clear to Lincoln that slavery was
not only the fomenting cause but also the chief factor of support
of the secessionist movement, and finally he came to the
conclusion that the “destruction” of this form of property was
an indispensable military proceeding. Even here though—and
contrary to the general knowledge of Americans today—definitions
were carefully made. The final document was not a
proclamation to emancipate slaves, but a proclamation to confiscate
the property of citizens in rebellion “as a fit and necessary
measure for suppressing said rebellion.” Its terms did not
emancipate all slaves, and as a matter of fact slavery was legal
in the District of Columbia until some time after Lincoln’s
death.</p>

<p>In view of Lincoln’s frequent reliance upon the argument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
from definition, it becomes a matter of interest to inquire
whether he appears to have realized that many of his problems
were problems of definition. One can of course employ a type
of argument without being aware of much more than its <i>ad
hoc</i> success, but we should expect a reflective mind like Lincoln’s
to ponder at times the abstract nature of his method.
Furthermore, the extraordinary accuracy with which he used
words is evidence pointing in the same direction. Sensitivity
on the score of definitions is tantamount to sensitivity on the
score of names, and we find the following in the First Message
to Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It might seem, at first thought, to be of little difference whether
the present movement at the South be called “secession” or “rebellion.”
The movers, however, well understand the difference. At the
beginning they knew they could never raise their reason to any
respectable magnitude by any name which implies violation of
law.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Lincoln must at times have viewed his whole career as a
battle against the “miners and sappers” of those names which
expressed the national ideals. His chief charge against Douglas
and the equivocal upholders of “squatter sovereignty” was
that they were trying to circumvent definitions, and during
the war period he had to meet the same sort of attempts. Lincoln’s
most explicit statement by far on the problem appears
in a short talk made at one of the “Sanitary Fairs” it was his
practice to attend. Speaking this time at Baltimore in the
spring of 1864, he gave one of those timeless little lessons
which have made such an impression on men’s minds.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty,
and the American people, just now, are much in want of one. We
all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all
mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
each man to do as he pleases, with himself, and with the product
of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some
men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other
men’s labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible
things, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each
of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different
and incompatible names—liberty and tyranny.</p>

<p>The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep’s throat, for which
the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf
denounces him for the same act, as the destroyer of liberty, especially
as the sheep was a black one. Plainly, the sheep and the wolf
are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty; and precisely
the same difference prevails today among us human creatures, even
in the North, and all professing to love liberty.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So the difficulty appeared in his time, and it should hardly be
necessary to point out that no period of modern history has
been more in need of this little homily on the subject of definition
than the first half of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The relationship between words and essences did then
occur to Lincoln as a problem, and we can show how he was
influenced in one highly important particular by his attention
to this relationship.</p>

<p>Fairly early in his struggle against Douglas and others
whom he conceived to be the foes of the Union, Lincoln became
convinced that the perdurability of laws and other institutions
is bound up with the acceptance of the principle of
contradiction. Or, if that seems an unduly abstract way of
putting the matter, let us say that he came to repudiate, as
firmly as anyone in practical politics may do, those people who
try by relativistic interpretations and other sophistries to
evade the force of some basic principles. The heart of Lincoln’s
statesmanship, indeed, lay in his perception that on
some matters one has to say “Yes” or “No,” that one has to
accept an alternative to the total exclusion of the other, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
that any weakness in being thus bold is a betrayal. Let us examine
some of the stages by which this conviction grew upon
him.</p>

<p>It seems not generally appreciated that this position comprises
the essence of the celebrated “House Divided” speech,
delivered before the Republican State Convention at Springfield,
June 16, 1858. There he said: “‘A house divided against
itself cannot stand.’ I believe this government cannot endure
permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the
Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I
do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one
thing or all the other.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> How manifest it is that Lincoln’s position
was not one of “tolerance,” as that word is vulgarly understood
today. It was a definite insistence upon right, with no
regard for latitude and longitude in moral questions. For Lincoln
such questions could neither be relativistically decided
nor held in abeyance. There was no middle ground. In the
light of American political tradition the stand is curiously absolute,
but it is there—and it is genuinely expressive of Lincoln’s
matured view.</p>

<p>Douglas had made the fatal mistake of looking for a position
in the excluded middle. He had been trying to get slavery
admitted into the territories by feigning that the institution
was morally indifferent. His platform declaration had been
that he did not care “whether it is voted up or voted down” in
the territories. That statement made a fine opening for Lincoln,
which he used as follows in his reply at Alton:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery,
but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it;
because no man can logically say he don’t care whether a wrong
is voted up or down. He may say he don’t care whether an indifferent
thing is voted up or down, but he must logically have a choice
between a right thing and a wrong thing. He contends that whatever
community wants slaves has a right to have them. So they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
have if it is not a wrong. But if it is a wrong, he cannot say people
have a right to do a wrong.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a speech at Cincinnati the following year, he used a figure
from the Bible to express his opposition to compromise.
“The good old maxims of the Bible are applicable, and truly
applicable, to human affairs, and in this, as in other things, we
may say here that he who is not for us is against us; he who
gathereth not with us scattereth.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In the Address at Cooper
Union Institute, February 27, 1860, Lincoln took long enough
to describe the methodology of this dodge by Douglas and
his supporters. It was, as we have indicated, an attempt to
squeeze into the excluded middle. “Let us be diverted by none
of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously
plied and belabored—contrivances such as groping for
some middle ground between the right and the wrong: vain
as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor
a dead man; such as a policy of ‘don’t care’ on a question about
which all true men do care....”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Finally, and most eloquently
of all, there is the brief passage from his “Meditation on the
Divine Will,” composed sometime in 1862. “The will of God
prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance
with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be,
wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the
same time.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> God too is a rational being and will not be found
embracing both sides of a contradictory. Where mutual negation
exists, God must be found on one side, and Lincoln hopes,
though he does not here claim, that God is in the Union’s corner
of this square of opposition.</p>

<p>The fact that Lincoln’s thought became increasingly logical
under the pressure of events is proof of great depths in the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Now as we take a general view of Lincoln’s habit of defining
in its relation to his political thought, we see that it gave him
one quality in which he is unrivalled by any other American
leader—the quality of perspective. The connection of the two
is a necessary one. To define is to assume perspective; that is
the method of definition. Since nothing can be defined until it
is placed in a category and distinguished from its near relatives,
it is obvious that definition involves the taking of a general
view. Definition must see the thing in relation to other
things, as that relation is expressible through substance, magnitude,
kind, cause, effect, and other particularities. It is
merely different expression to say that this is a view which
transcends: perspective, detachment, and capacity to transcend
are all requisites of him who would define, and we know
that Lincoln evidenced these qualities quite early in life,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and
that he employed them with consummate success when the
future of the nation depended on his judgment.</p>

<p>Let us remember that Lincoln was a leader in the most bitter
partisan trial in our history; yet within short decades after
his death he had achieved sanctuary. His name is now immune
against partisan rancor, and he has long ceased to be a mere
sectional hero. The lesson of these facts is that greatness is
found out and appreciated just as littleness is found out and
scorned, and Lincoln proved his greatness through his habit
of transcending and defining his objects. The American scene
of his time invites the colloquial adjective “messy”—with human
slavery dividing men geographically and spiritually, with
a fluid frontier, and with the problems of labor and capital and
of immigration already beginning to exert their pressures—but
Lincoln looked at these things in perspective and refused to
look at them in any other way.</p>

<p>For an early example of this characteristic vision of his, we
may go back to the speech delivered before the Young Men’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Lyceum in 1838. The opening is significant. “In the great journal
of things happening under the sun, we the American people,
find our account running under date of the nineteenth
century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful
possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent
of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> So
Lincoln takes as his point of perspective all time, of which the
Christian era is but a portion; and the entire earth, of which
the United States can be viewed as a specially favored part.
This habit of viewing things from an Olympian height never
left him. We might cite also the opening of the Speech at
Peoria, and that of the Speech at the Cooper Union Institute;
but let us pass on twenty-five years and re-read the first sentence
of the Gettysburg Address. “Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all
men are created equal.” Again tremendous perspective, suggesting
almost that Lincoln was looking at the little act from
some ultimate point in space and time. “Fourscore and seven
years ago” carries the listener back to the beginning of the
nation. “This continent” again takes the whole world into
purview. “Our fathers” is an auxiliary suggestion of the continuum
of time. The phrase following defines American political
philosophy in the most general terms possible. The entire
opening sentence, with its sustained detachment, sounds like
an account of the action to be rendered at Judgment Day. It is
not Abe Lincoln who is speaking the utterance, but the voice
of mankind, as it were, to whom the American Civil War is but
the passing vexation of a generation. And as for the “brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here,” it takes two to
make a struggle, and is there anything to indicate that the men
in gray are excluded? There is nothing explicit, and therefore
we may say that Lincoln looked as far ahead as he looked
behind in commemorating the event of Gettysburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>This habit of perspective led Lincoln at times to take an
extraordinarily objective view of his own actions—more frequently
perhaps as he neared the end of his career. It was as if
he projected a view in which history was the duration, the
world the stage, and himself a transitory actor upon it. Of all
his utterances the Second Inaugural is in this way the most
objective and remote. Its tone even seems that of an actor
about to quit the stage. His self-effacement goes to the extent
of impersonal constructions, so that in places Lincoln appears
to be talking about another person. “At this second appearing
to take the oath of the Presidential office, there is less occasion
for an extended address than there was at the first.” “At this
second appearing”! Is there any way of gathering, except from
our knowledge of the total situation, who is thus appearing?
Then after a generalized review of the military situation, he
declares: “With high hope for the future, no prediction in
regard to it is ventured.” Why “is ventured” rather than “I
venture”? Lincoln had taught himself to view the war as one
of God’s processes worked out through human agents, and the
impersonality of tone of this last and most deeply meditative
address may arise from that habit. Only once, in the modest
qualifying phrase “I trust,” does the pronoun “I” appear; and
the final classic paragraph is spoken in the name of “us.” There
have been few men whose processes of mind so well deserve
the epithet <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> as Lincoln’s.</p>

<p>It goes without further demonstration that Lincoln transcended
the passions of the war. How easy it is for a leader
whose political and personal prestige are at stake to be carried
along with the tide of hatred of a people at war, we have,
unhappily, seen many times. No other victor in a civil conflict
has conducted himself with more humanity, and this not in
some fine gesture after victory was secured—although there
was that too—but during the struggle, while the issue was still
in doubt and maximum strain was placed upon the feelings.
Without losing sight of his ultimate goal, he treated everyone
with personal kindness, including people who went out of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
way in attempts to wound him. And probably it was his habit
of looking at things through objective definitions which kept
him from confusing being logically right with being personally
right. In the “Meditation on the Divine Will” he wrote, “In
the present civil war it is quite possible that God’s purpose is
something different from the purpose of either party....”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
That could be written only by one who has attained the highest
level of self-discipline. It explains too why he should write,
in his letter to Cuthbert Bullitt: “I shall do nothing in malice.
What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Lastly,
there is the extraordinary confession of common guilt in the
Second Inaugural Address, which, if it had been honored by
the government he led, would have constituted a step without
precedent in history in the achievement of reconciliation after
war. It is supposable, Lincoln said, that God has given “to both
North and South this terrible war.” Hardly seventy-five years
later we were to see nations falling into the ancient habit of
claiming exclusive right in their quarrels and even of demanding
unconditional surrender. As late as February, 1865, Lincoln
stood ready to negotiate, and his offer, far from requiring
“unconditional surrender,” required but one condition—return
of the seceded states to the Union.</p>

<p>There is, when we reflect upon the matter, a certain morality
in clarity of thought, and the man who had learned to
define with Euclid and who had kept his opponents in argument
out of the excluded middle, could not be pushed into a
settlement which satisfied only passion. The settlement had to
be objectively right. Between his world view and his mode of
argument and his response to great occasions there is a relationship
so close that to speak of any one apart is to leave the
exposition incomplete.</p>

<p>With the full career in view, there seems no reason to differ
with Herndon’s judgment that Lincoln displayed a high order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of “conservative statesmanship.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> It is true that Lincoln has
been placed in almost every position, from right to left, on the
political arc. Our most radical parties have put forward programs
in his name; and Professor J. G. Randall has written an
unconvincing book on “Lincoln the Liberal Statesman.” Such
variety of estimate underlines the necessity of looking for
some more satisfactory criterion by which to place the man
politically. It will not do to look simply at the specific measures
he has supported. If these were the standard, George
Washington would have to be regarded as a great progressive;
Imperial Germany would have to be regarded as liberal, or
even as radical, by the token of its social reforms. It seems
right to assume that a much surer index to a man’s political
philosophy is his characteristic way of thinking, inevitably
expressed in the type of argument he prefers. In reality, the
type of argument a man chooses gives us the profoundest look
we get at his principle of integration. By this method Burke,
who was partial to the argument from circumstance, must be
described as a liberal, whose blast against the French Revolution
was, even in his own words, an attack from center against
an extreme. Those who argue from consequence tend to go
all out for action; they are the “radicals.” Those who prefer the
argument from definition, as Lincoln did, are conservatives
in the legitimate sense of the word. It is no accident that Lincoln
became the founder of the greatest American conservative
party, even if that party was debauched soon after his
career ended. He did so because his method was that of the
conservative.</p>

<p>The true conservative is one who sees the universe as a paradigm
of essences, of which the phenomenology of the world is
a sort of continuing approximation. Or, to put this in another
way, he sees it as a set of definitions which are struggling to
get themselves defined in the real world. As Lincoln remarked
of the Framers of the Declaration of Independence: “They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which
should be familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked
to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly
attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly
spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the
happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
This paradigm acts both as an inspiration to action
and as a constraint upon over-action, since there is always a
possibility of going beyond the schemata into an excess. Lincoln
opposed both slavery and the Abolitionists (the Abolitionists
constituted a kind of “action” party); yet he was not
a middle-of-the-roader. Indeed, for one who grew up a Whig,
he is astonishingly free from tendency to assume that “the
truth lies somewhere in between.” The truth lay where intellect
and logic found it, and he was not abashed by clearness
of outline.</p>

<p>This type of conservative is sometimes found fighting quite
briskly for change; but if there is one thing by which he is
distinguished, it is a trust in the methods of law. For him law is
the embodiment of abstract justice; it is not “what the courts
will decide tomorrow,” or a calculation of the forces at work in
society. A sentence from the First Inaugural Address will give
us the conservative’s view of pragmatic jurisprudence: “I do
suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and
private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts
which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting
to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
The essence of Lincoln’s doctrine was not the seeking of a
middle, but reform according to law; that is, reform according
to definition. True conservatism can be intellectual in the same
way as true classicism. It is one of the polar positions; and it
deserves an able exponent as well as does its vivifying opposite,
true radicalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>After Lincoln had left the scene, the Republican Party, as
we have noted, was unable to meet the test of victory. It
turned quickly to the worship of Mammon, and with the exception
of the ambiguous Theodore Roosevelt, it never found
another leader. No one understood better than Lincoln that
the party would have to succeed upon principle. He told his
followers during the campaign of 1858: “nobody has ever expected
me to be President. In my poor, lean, lank face nobody
has even seen that any cabbages were sprouting out. These
are disadvantages all, taken together, that the Republicans
labor under. We have to fight this battle upon principle and
upon principle alone.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> For two generations this party lived
upon the moral capital amassed during the anti-slavery campaign,
but after that had been expended, and terrible issues
had to be faced, it possessed nothing. It was less successful
than the British Tories because it was either ignorant or
ashamed of the good things it had to offer. Today it shows in
advanced form that affliction which has overcome the “good
elements” in all modern nations in the face of the bold and
enterprising bad ones.</p>

<p>Let it be offered as a parting counsel that parties bethink
themselves of how their chieftains speak. This is a world in
which one often gets what one asks for more directly or more
literally than one expects. If a leader asks only consequences,
he will find himself involved in naked competition of forces.
If he asks only circumstance, he will find himself intimidated
against all vision. But if he asks for principle, he may get that,
all tied up and complete, and though purchased at a price,
paid for. Therefore it is of first importance whether a leader
has the courage to define. Nowhere does a man’s rhetoric
catch up with him more completely than in the topics he
chooses to win other men’s assent.</p>

SOME RHETORICAL ASPECTS OF GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES</h2>

</div>

<p>In an earlier part of this work we defined rhetoric as
something which creates an informed appetition for the
good. Such definition must recognize the rhetorical force
of things existing outside the realm of speech; but since our
concern is primarily with spoken rhetoric, which cannot be
disengaged from certain patterns or regularities of language,
we now turn our attention to the pressure of these formal
patterns.</p>

<p>All students of language concede to it a certain public
character. Insofar as it serves in communication, it is a publicly-agreed-upon
thing; and when one passes the outer limits
of the agreement, one abandons comprehensibility. Now
rhetoric affects us primarily by setting forth images which
inform and attract. Yet because this setting forth is accomplished
through a public instrumentality, it is not free; it is
tied more or less closely to the formalizations of usage. The
more general and rigid of these formalizations we recognize
as grammar, and we shall here speak of grammar as a system
of forms of public speech. In the larger aspect, discourse is at
once bound and free, and we are here interested to discover
how the bound character affects our ability to teach and to
persuade.</p>

<p>We soon realize that different ways of saying a thing denote
different interests in saying it, or to take this in reverse as we
do when we become conscious users of language, different interests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in a matter will dictate different patterns of expression.
Rhetoric in its practice is a matter of selection and arrangement,
but conventional grammar imposes restraints upon both
of these. All this amounts to saying what every sensitive user
of language has sometimes felt; namely, that language is not
a purely passive instrument, but that, owing to this public
acceptance, while you are doing something with it, it is doing
something with you, or with your intention.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> It does not exactly
fight back; rather it has a set of postures and balances which
somehow modify your thrusts and holds. The sentence form
is certainly one of these. You pour into it your meaning, and
it deflects, and molds into certain shapes. The user of language
must know how this counterpressure can be turned
to the advantage of his general purpose. The failure of those
who are careless, or insensitive, to the rhetoric of grammar is
that they allow the counter force to impede their design,
whereas a perspicacious use of it will forward the design. One
cannot, for example, employ just any modifier to stand for a
substantive or just any substantive to express a quality, or
change a stabilized pattern of arrangement without a change
in net effect, although some of these changes register but
faintly. But style shows through an accumulation of small
particulars, and the artist in language may ponder a long while,
as Conrad is said to have done, over whether to describe a
character as “penniless” or “without a penny.”</p>

<p>In this approach, then, we are regarding language as a standard
objective reality, analyzable into categories which have
inherent potentialities. A knowledge of these objective potentialities
can prevent a loss of force through friction. The friction
we refer to occurs whenever a given unit of the system of
grammar is tending to say one thing while the semantic meaning
and the general organization are tending to say another.
A language has certain abilities or even inclinations which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the wise user can draw into the service of his own rhetorical
effort. Using a language may be compared to riding a horse;
much of one’s success depends upon an understanding of what
it <i>can</i> and <i>will</i> do. Or to employ a different figure in illustration,
there is a kind of use of language which goes against the
grain as that grain is constituted by the categories, and there
is a kind which facilitates the speaker’s projection by going
with it. Our task is an exploration of the congruence between
well understood rhetorical objectives and the inherent character
of major elements in modern English.</p>

<p>The problem of which category to begin with raises some
questions. It is arguable that the rhetoric of any piece is dependent
upon its total intention, and that consequently no
single sentence can be appraised apart from the tendency of
the whole discourse. Our position does not deny that, since
we are assuming merely that within the greater effect there
are lesser effects, cooperating well or ill. Having accepted that
limitation, it seems permissible for us to begin with the largest
unit of grammar, which is the sentence. We shall take up first
the sentence as such and then discriminate between formal
types of sentences.</p>

<p>Because a sentence form exists in most if not all languages,
there is some ground to suppose that it reflects a necessary
operation of the mind, and this means not simply of the mind
as psychologically constituted but also as logically constrained.</p>

<p>It is evident that when the mind frames a sentence, it performs
the basic intellectual operation of analysis and re-synthesis.
In this complete operation the mind is taking two or
more classes and uniting them at least to the extent at which
they share in a formal unity. The unity itself, built up through
many such associations, comes to have an existence all its
own, as we shall see. It is the repeated congruence in experience
or in the imagination of such classes as “sun-heat,” “snow-cold,”
which establishes the pattern, but our point is that the
pattern once established can become disciplinary in itself and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
compel us to look for meaning within the formal unity it imposes.
So it is natural for us to perceive through a primitive
analysis the compresence of sun and hot weather, and to
combine these into the unity “the sun is hot”; but the articulation
represented by this joining now becomes a thing in itself,
which can be grasped before the meaning of its component
parts is evident. Accordingly, although sentences are supposed
to grow out of meanings, we can have sentences before meanings
are apparent, and this is indeed the central point of our
rhetoric of grammar. When we thus grasp the scope of the
pattern before we interpret the meaning of the components,
we are being affected by grammatical system.</p>

<p>I should like to put this principle to a supreme sort of test
by using a few lines of highly modern verse. In Allen Tate’s
poem “The Subway” we find the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I am become geometries, and glut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expansions like a blind astronomer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dazed, while the wordless heavens bulge and reel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the cold reverie of an idiot.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I do not propose to interpret this further than to say that the
features present of word classification and word position cause
us to look for meaning along certain lines. It seems highly
probable that we shall have to exercise much imagination to
fit our classes together with meaning as they are fitted by formal
classification and sentence order (“I am become geometries”);
yet it remains true that we take in the first line as a
formal predication; and I do not think that this formal character
could ever be separated entirely from the substance in
an interpretation. Once we gain admission of that point with
regard to a sentence, some rhetorical status for grammar has
been definitely secured.</p>

<p>In total rhetorical effect the sentence seems to be peculiarly
“the thing said,” whereas all other elements are “the things
named.” And accordingly the right to utter a sentence is one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
of the very greatest liberties; and we are entitled to little wonder
that freedom of utterance should be, in every society, one
of the most contentious and ill-defined rights. The liberty to
impose this formal unity is a liberty to handle the world, to
remake it, if only a little, and to hand it to others in a shape
which may influence their actions. It is interesting to speculate
whether the Greeks did not, for this very reason, describe
the man clever at speech as δεινός, an epithet meaning, in addition
to “clever,” “fearful” and “terrible.” The sentence through
its office of assertion is a force adding itself to the forces of the
world, and therefore the man clever with his sentences—which
is to say with his combinations—was regarded with that uneasiness
which we feel in the presence of power. The changes
wrought by sentences are changes in the world rather than in
the physical earth, but it is to be remembered that changes
in the world bring about changes in the earth. Thus this practice
of yoking together classes of the world, of saying “Charles
is King” or “My country is God’s country” is a unique rhetorical
fact which we have to take into account, although it stands
somewhat prior to our main discussion.</p>

<p>As we turn now to the different formal types of sentences,
we shall follow the traditional grammatical classification and
discuss the rhetorical inclination of each in turn.</p>

<p>Through its form, the simple sentence tends to emphasize
the discreteness of phenomena within the structural unity. To
be more specific, its pattern of subject-verb-object or complement,
without major competing elements, leaves our attention
fixed upon the classes involved: “Charles is King.” The effect
remains when the simple sentence compounds its subject and
predicate: “Peaches and cantaloupes grew in abundance”;
“Men and boys hunted and fished.” The single subject-predicate
frame has the broad sense of listing or itemizing, and the
list becomes what the sentence is about semantically.</p>

<p>Sentences of this kind are often the unconscious style of one
who sees the world as a conglomerate of things, like the child;
sometimes they are the conscious style of one who seeks to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
present certain things as eminent against a background of
matter uniform or flat. One can imagine, for example, the
simple sentence “He never worked” coming after a long and
tedious recital which it is supposed to highlight. Or one can
imagine the sentence “The world is round” leaping out of a
context with which it contrasts in meaning, in brevity, or in
sententiousness.</p>

<p>There is some descriptive value in saying that the simple
sentence is the most “logical” type of sentence because, like
the simple categorical proposition, it has this function of relating
two classes. This fact, combined with its usual brevity
and its structural simplicity, makes it a useful sentence for
beginnings and endings (of important meaning-groups, not
so much of formal introductions and conclusions). It is a sentence
of unclouded perspective, so to speak. Nothing could be
more beautifully anticipatory than Burke’s “The proposition
is peace.”</p>

<p>At the very minimum, we can affirm that the simple sentence
tends to throw subject and predicate classes into relief
by the structure it presents them in; that the two-part categorical
form of its copulation indicates a positive mood on the
part of the user, and that its brevity often induces a generality
of approach, which is an aid to perspicuous style. These
opportunities are found out by the speaker or writer who
senses the need for some synoptic or dramatic spot in his discourse.
Thus when he selects the simple sentence, he is going
“with the grain”; he is putting the objective form to work for
him.</p>

<p>The complex sentence has a different potentiality. Whereas
the simple sentence emphasizes through its form the co-existence
of classes (and it must be already apparent that we
regard “things existing or occurring” as a class where the predicate
consists only of a verb), the complex sentence emphasizes
a more complex relationship; that is to say, it reflects
another kind of discriminating activity, which does not stop
with seeing discrete classes as co-existing, but distinguishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
them according to rank or value, or places them in an order of
cause and effect. “Rome fell because valor declined” is the
utterance of a reflective mind because the conjunction of parts
depends on something ascertainable by the intellect but not
by simple perception. This is evidence that the complex sentence
does not appear until experience has undergone some
refinement by the mind. Then, because it goes beyond simple
observation and begins to perceive things like causal principle,
or begins to grade things according to a standard of
interest, it brings in the notion of dependence to supplement
that of simple togetherness. And consequently the complex
sentence will be found nearly always to express some sort of
hierarchy, whether spatial, moral, or causal, with its subordinate
members describing the lower orders. In simple-sentence
style we would write: “Tragedy began in Greece. It is
the highest form of literary art.” There is no disputing that
these sentences, in this sequence, could have a place in mature
expression. But they do not have the same effect as “Tragedy,
which is the highest form of literary art, began in Greece” or
“Tragedy, which began in Greece, is the highest form of literary
art.” What has occurred is the critical process of subordination.
The two ideas have been transferred from a conglomerate
to an articulated unity, and the very fact of subordination
makes inevitable the emergence of a focus of interest.
Is our passage about the highest form of literary art or about
the cultural history of Greece? The form of the complex sentence
makes it unnecessary to waste any words in explicit
assertion of that. Here it is plain that grammatical form is
capital upon which we can draw, provided that other necessities
have been taken care of.</p>

<p>To see how a writer of consummate sensibility toward expression-forms
proceeded, let us take a fairly typical sentence
from Henry James:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Merton Densher, who passed the best hours of each night at the
office of his newspaper, had at times, during the day, a sense, or at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
least an appearance, of leisure, in accordance with which he was
not infrequently to be met, in different parts of the town, at moments
when men of business were hidden from the public eye.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Leaving aside the phrases, which are employed by James in
extension and refinement of the same effect, we see here three
dependent clauses used to explain the contingencies of “Merton
Densher had an appearance of leisure.” These clauses have
the function of surrounding the central statement in such a
fashion that we have an intricate design of thought characterized
by involution, or the emergence of one detail out of
another. James’ famous practice of using the dependent clause
not only for qualification, but for the qualification of qualification,
and in some cases for the qualification of qualification of
qualification, indicates a persistent sorting out of experience
expressive of the highly civilized mind. Perhaps the leading
quality of the civilized mind is that it is sophisticated as to
causes and effects (also as to other contiguities); and the complex
sentence, required to give these a scrupulous ordering,
is its natural vehicle.</p>

<p>At the same time the spatial form of ordering to which the
complex sentence lends itself makes it a useful tool in scientific
analysis, and one can find brilliant examples of it in the work
of scientists who have been skillful in communication. When
T. H. Huxley, for instance, explains a piece of anatomy, the
complex sentence is the frame of explanation. In almost every
sentence it will be observed that he is focussing interest upon
one part while keeping its relationship—spatial or causal—clear
with reference to surrounding parts. In Huxley’s expository
prose, therefore, one finds the dominant sentence type
to consist of a main clause at the beginning followed by a
series of dependent clauses which fill in these facts of relationship.
We may follow the pattern of the sentences in his account
of the protoplasm of the common nettle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Each stinging-needle tapers from a broad base to a slender summit,
which, though rounded at the end, is of such microscopic
fineness that it readily penetrates, and breaks off in, the skin. The
whole hair consists of a very delicate outer case of wood, closely
applied to the inner surface of which is a layer of semi-fluid matter
full of innumerable granules of extreme minuteness. This semi-fluid
lining is protoplasm, which thus constitutes a kind of bag, full
of limpid liquid, and roughly corresponding in form with the interior
of the hair which it fills.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is, of course, the “loose” sentence of traditional rhetorical
analysis, and it has no dramatic force; yet it is for this very
reason adapted to the scientist’s purpose.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The rhetorical adaptation
shows in the accommodation of a little hierarchy of
details.</p>

<p>This appears to be the sentence of a developed mentality
also, because it is created through a patient, disciplined observation,
and not through impression, as the simple sentence
can be. To the infant’s mind, as William James observed in a
now famous passage, the world is a “buzzing, blooming confusion,”
and to the immature mind much older it often appears
something done in broad, uniform strokes. But to the mind of
a trained scientist it has to appear a cosmos—else, no science.
So in Huxley the objective world is presented as a series of
details, each of which has its own cluster of satellites in the
form of minor clauses. This is the way the world has to be reported
when our objective is maximum perception and minimum
desire to obtrude or influence.</p>

<p>Henry James was explaining with a somewhat comparable
interest a different kind of world, in which all sorts of human
and non-material forces are at work, and he tried with extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
conscientiousness to measure them. In that process of quantification
and qualification the complex sentence was often
brought by him to an extraordinary height of ramification.</p>

<p>In summation, then, the complex sentence is the branching
sentence, or the sentence with parts growing off other parts.
Those who have used it most properly have performed a second
act of analysis, in which the objects of perception, after
being seen discretely, are put into a ranked structure. This
type of sentence imposes the greatest demand upon the reader
because it carries him farthest into the reality existing outside
self. This point will take on importance as we turn to the compound
sentence.</p>

<p>The structure of the compound sentence often reflects a
simple artlessness—the uncritical pouring together of simple
sentences, as in the speech of Huckleberry Finn. The child
who is relating an adventure is likely to make it a flat recital
of conjoined simple predications, because to him the important
fact is that the things were, not that they can be read to
signify this or that. His even juxtapositions are therefore sometimes
amusing, for now and then he will produce a coordination
that unintentionally illuminates. This would, of course,
be a result of lack of control over the rhetoric of grammar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the compound sentence can be a very
“mature” sentence when its structure conforms with a settled
view of the world. The latter possibility will be seen as we
think of the balance it presents. When a sentence consists of
two main clauses we have two predications of similar structure
bidding for our attention. Our first supposal is that this
produces a sentence of unusual tension, with two equal parts
(and of course sometimes more than two equal parts) in a
sort of competition. Yet it appears on fuller acquaintance that
this tension is a tension of stasis, and that the compound sentence
has, in practice, been markedly favored by periods of
repose like that of the Eighteenth century. There is congeniality
between its internal balance and a concept of the world as
an equilibrium of forces. As a general rule, it appears that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
whereas the complex sentence favors the presentation of the
world as a system of facts or as a dynamism, the compound
sentence favors the presentation of it in a more or less philosophical
picture. This world as a philosophical cosmos will
have to be a sort of compensatory system. We know from other
evidences that the Eighteenth century loved to see things in
balance; in fact, it required the idea of balance as a foundation
for its institutions. Quite naturally then, since motives of
this kind reach into expression-forms, this was the age of
masters of the balanced sentence—Dryden, Johnson, Gibbon,
and others, the <i>genre</i> of whose style derives largely from
this practice of compounding. Often the balance which they
achieved was more intricate than simple conjunction of main
clauses because they balanced lesser elements too, but the
informing impulse was the same. That impulse was the desire
for counterpoise, which was one of the powerful motives of
their culture.</p>

<p>In this pattern of balance, various elements are used in the
offsettings. Thus when one attends closely to the meanings
of the balanced parts, one finds these compounds recurring:
an abstract statement is balanced (in a second independent
clause) by a more concrete expression of the same thing; a
fact is balanced by its causal explanation; a statement of positive
mode is balanced by one of negative mode; a clause of
praise is balanced by a clause of qualified censure; a description
of one part is balanced by a description of a contrasting
part, and so on through a good many conventional pairings.
Now in these collocations cause and effect and other relationships
are presented, yet the attempt seems not so much to
explore reality as to clothe it in decent form. Culture is a delicate
reconciliation of opposites, and consequently a man who
sees the world through the eyes of a culture makes effort in
this direction. We know that the world of Eighteenth century
culture was a rationalist world, and in a rationalist world
everything must be “accounted for.” The virtue of the compound
sentence is that its second part gives “the other half,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
so to speak. As the pattern works out, every fact has its cause;
every virtue is compensated for by a vice; every excursion into
generality must be made up for by attention to concrete circumstances
and vice versa. The perfection of this art form is
found in Johnson and Gibbon, where such pairings occur with
a frequency which has given rise to the phrase “the balanced
style.” When Gibbon, for example, writes of religion in the
Age of the Antonines: “The superstition of the people was not
embittered by any mixture of theological rancour; nor was it
confined by the chains of any speculative system,”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> we have
almost the feeling that the case of religion has been settled by
this neat artifice of expression. This is a “just” view of affairs,
which sees both sides and leaves a kind of balanced account.
It looks somewhat subjective, or at least humanized; it gives
us the gross world a little tidied up by thought. Often, moreover,
this balance of structure together with the act of saying
a thing equivocally—in the narrower etymological sense of
that word—suggests the finality of art. This will be found true
of many of the poetical passages of the King James Bible, although
these come from an earlier date. “The heavens declare
the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork”;
“Man cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he fleeth also
as a shadow and continueth not.” By thus stating the matter
in two ways, through balanced clauses, the sentence achieves
a degree of formal completeness missing in sentences where
the interest is in mere assertion. Generally speaking the balanced
compound sentence, by the very contrivedness of its
structure, suggests something formed above the welter of
experience, and this form, as we have by now substantially
said, transfers something of itself to the meaning. In declaring
that the compound sentence may seem subjective, we are not
saying that it is arbitrary, its correspondence being with the
philosophical interpretation rather than with the factual reality.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Thus if the complex sentence is about the world, the compound
sentence is about our idea about the world, into which
some notion of compensation forces itself. One notices that
even Huxley, when he draws away from his simple expositions
of fact and seeks play for his great powers of persuasion,
begins to compound his sentences. On the whole, the compound
sentence conveys that completeness and symmetry
which the world <i>ought</i> to have, and which we manage to get,
in some measure, into our most satisfactory explanations of it.
It is most agreeable to those ages and those individuals who
feel that they have come to terms with the world, and are
masters in a domain. But understandably enough, in a world
which has come to be centrifugal and infinite, as ours has become
since the great revolutions, it tends to seem artificial and
mechanical in its containment.</p>

<p>Since the difference between sentence and clause is negligible
as far as the issues of this subject are concerned, we shall
next look at the word, and conclude with a few remarks on
some lesser combinations. This brings up at once the convention
of parts of speech. Here again I shall follow the traditional
classification, on the supposition that categories to which
usage is referred for correction have accumulated some rhetorical
force, whatever may be said for the merits of some
other and more scientific classification.</p>

<h3><i>The Noun</i></h3>

<p>It is difficult not to feel that both usage and speculation
agree on the rhetorical quality of nouns. The noun derives its
special dignity from being a <i>name</i> word, and names persist,
in spite of all the cautions of modern semanticists, in being
thought of as words for substances. We apprehend the significance
of that when we realize that in the ancient philosophical
regimen to which the West is heir, and which influences
our thought far more than we are aware at any one
moment, substances are assigned a higher degree of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
than actions or qualities. Substance is that which primordially
<i>is</i>, and one may doubt whether recent attempts to revolutionize
both ontology and grammar have made any impression at
all against this feeling. For that reason a substantive comes to
us as something that is peculiarly fulfilled;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> or it is like a
piece in a game which has superior powers of movement and
capture. The fact that a substantive is the word in a sentence
which the other words are “about” in various relationships
gives it a superior status.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Nouns then express things whose being is completed, not
whose being is in process, or whose being depends upon some
other being. And that no doubt accounts for the feeling that
when one is using nouns, one is manipulating the symbols of a
self-subsistent reality.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> There seems little doubt that an ancient
metaphysical system, grown to be an <i>habitus</i> of the mind
through long acceptance, gives the substantive word a prime
status, and this fact has importance when we come to compare
the noun with the adjective in power to convince by making
real. Suffice it to say here that the noun, whether it be a pointer
to things that one can touch and see, as <i>apple</i>, <i>bird</i>, <i>sky</i>, or to
the more or less hypothetical substances such as <i>fairness</i>,
<i>spook</i>, <i>nothingness</i>, by rule stands at the head of things and is
ministered to by the other parts of speech and by combinations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Adjective</i></h3>

<p>The adjective is, by the principle of determination just
reviewed, a word of secondary status and force. Its burden is
an attribute, or something added. In the order of being to
which reference has been made, the noun can exist without
the adjective, but not the adjective without the noun. Thus
we can have “men” without having “excellent men”; but we
cannot have “excellent” without having something (if only
something understood) to receive the attribution. There are
very practical rhetorical lessons to be drawn from this truth.
Since adjectives express attributes which are conceptually
dispensable to the substances wherein they are present, the
adjective tends to be a supernumerary. Long before we are
aware of this fact through analysis, we sense it through our
resentment of any attempt to gain maximum effect through
the adjective. Our intuition of speech seems to tell us that the
adjective is question-begging; that is to say, if the thing to be
expressed is real, it will be expressed through a substantive;
if it is expressed mainly through adjectives, there is something
defective in its reality, since it has gone for secondary support.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
If someone should say to us, “Have some white milk,”
we must suppose either that the situation is curious, other
kinds of milk being available, or that the speaker is trying to
impose upon us by a piece of persiflage. Again, a mountain is
a mountain without being called “huge”; if we have to call it
huge, there is some defect in the original image which is being
made up. Of course there are speech situations in which such
modifiers do make a useful contribution, but as a general rule,
to be applied with discretion, a style is stronger when it depends
mainly upon substantives sharp enough to convey their
own attributes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, because the class of the adjective contains so
many terms of dialectical import, such as <i>good</i>, <i>evil</i>, <i>noble</i>,
<i>base</i>, <i>useful</i>, <i>useless</i>, there is bound to exist an initial suspicion
of all adjectives. (Even when they are the positive kind, as is
true with most limiting adjectives, there lurk the questions
“Who made up the statistics?” and “How were they gathered?”)
The dialectical adjective is too often a “fighting word”
to be used casually. Because in its very origin it is the product
of disputation, one is far from being certain in advance of
assent to it. How would you wish to characterize the world?
If you wish to characterize it as “round,” you will win a very
general assent, although not a universal one. But if you wish,
with the poet, to characterize it as “sorry,” you take a position
in respect to which there are all sorts of contrary positions. In
strictest thought one might say that every noun contains its
own analysis, but an adjective applied to a noun is apparatus
brought in from the outside; and the result is the object slightly
“fictionized.” Since adjectives thus initiate changes in the
more widely received substantive words, one has to have permission
of his audience to talk in adjectives. Karl Shapiro
seems to have had something like this in mind in the following
passage from his <i>Essay on Rime</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">for the tyrannical epithet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Relies upon the adjective to produce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The image; and no serious construction</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In rime can build upon the modifier.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the common mistakes of the inexperienced writer,
in prose as well as poetry, is to suppose that the adjective can
set the key of a discourse. Later he learns what Shapiro indicates,
that nearly always the adjective has to have the way
prepared for it. Otherwise, the adjective introduced before
its noun collapses for want of support. There is a perceptible
difference between “the irresponsible conduct of the opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
with regard to the Smith bill” and “the conduct of the
opposition with regard to the Smith bill has been irresponsible,”
which is accounted for in part by the fact that the adjective
comes after the substantive has made its firm impression.
In like manner we are prepared to receive Henley’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of the night that covers me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Black as the Pit from pole to pole</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">because “night” has preceded “black.” I submit that if the
poem had begun “Black as ...” it would have lost a great deal
of its rhetorical force because of the inherent character of the
opening word. The adjective would have been felt presumptuous,
as it were, and probably no amount of supplementation
could have overcome this unfortunate effect.</p>

<p>I shall offer one more example to show that costly mistakes
in emphasis may result from supposing that the adjective can
compete with the noun. This one came under my observation,
and has remained with me as a classical instance of rhetorical
ineptitude. On a certain university campus “Peace Week” was
being observed, and a prominent part of the program was a
series of talks. The object of these talks was to draw attention
to those forces which seemed to be leading mankind toward
a third world war. One of the speakers undertook to point out
the extent to which the Western nations, and especially the
United States, were at fault. He declared that a chief source
of the bellicose tendency of the United States was its “proud
rectitude,” and it is this expression which I wish to examine
critically. The fault of the phrase is that it makes “rectitude”
the villain of the piece, whereas sense calls for making “pride.”
If we are correct in assigning the substantive a greater intrinsic
weight, then it follows that “rectitude” exerts the greater
force here. But rectitude is not an inciter of wars; it is
rather that rectitude which is made rigid or unreasonable by
pride which may be a factor in the starting of wars, and pride
is really the provoking agent. For the most fortunate effect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
then, the grammatical relationship should be reversed, and
we should have “rectitude” modifying “pride.” But since the
accident of linguistic development has not provided it with
an adjective form of equivalent meaning, let us try “pride of
rectitude.” This is not the best expression imaginable, but it
is somewhat better since it turns “proud” into a substantive
and demotes “rectitude” to a place in a prepositional phrase.
The weightings are now more in accordance with meaning:
what grammar had anomalously made the chief word is now
properly tributary, and we have a closer delineation of reality.
As it was, the audience went away confused and uninspired,
and I have thought of this ever since as a situation in
which a little awareness of the rhetoric of grammar—there
were other instances of imperceptive usage—could have
turned a merely well-intentioned speech into an effective one.</p>

<p>Having laid down this relationship between adjective and
substantive as a principle, we must not ignore the real or
seeming exceptions. For the alert reader will likely ask, what
about such combinations as “new potatoes,” “drunk men,” “a
warlike nation”? Are we prepared to say that in each of these
the substantive gets the major attention, that we are more
interested in “potatoes” than in their being “new,” in “men”
than their being “drunk,” and so forth? Is that not too complacent
a rule about the priority of the substantive over the
adjective?</p>

<p>We have to admit that there are certain examples in which
the adjective may eclipse the substantive. This may occur
(1) when one’s intonation (or italics) directs attention to the
modifier: “<i>white</i> horses”; “<i>five</i> dollars, not four.” (2) when
there is a striking clash of meaning between the adjective and
the substantive, such that one gives a second thought to the
modifier: “a murderous smile”; “a gentleman gambler.” (3)
when the adjective is naturally of such exciting associations
that it has become a sort of traditional introduction to matter
of moment: “a warlike nation”; “a desperate deed”; etc. Having
admitted these possibilities of departure from the rule, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
still feel right in saying that the rule has some force. It will be
found useful in cases which are doubtful, which are the cases
where no strong semantic or phonetic considerations override
the grammatical pattern. In brief, when the immediate
act of our mind does not tell us whether an expression should
be in this form or the other, the principle of the relationship
of adjective and substantive may settle the matter with an
insight which the particular instance has not called forth.</p>

<h3><i>The Adverb</i></h3>

<p>The adverb is distinguished from the other parts of speech
by its superior mobility; roughly speaking, it can locate itself
anywhere in the sentence, and this affords a clue to its character.
“Certainly the day is warm”; “The day certainly is
warm”; “The day is certainly warm”; “The day is warm certainly”
are all “normal” utterances. This superior mobility,
amounting to a kind of detachment, makes the adverb peculiarly
a word of judgment. Here the distinction between the
adverb and the adjective seems to be that the latter depends
more upon public agreement and less upon private intention
in its applications. It is a matter of common observation that
the adverb is used frequently to express an attitude which is
the speaker’s projection of himself. “Surely the war will end
soon” is not, for example, a piece of objective reporting but
an expression of subjective feeling. We of course recognize
degrees of difference in the personal or subjective element.
Thomas Carlyle is much given to the use of the adverb, and
when we study his adverbs in context, we discover that they
are often little more than explosions of feeling. They are employed
to make more positive, abrupt, sensational, or intense
whatever his sentence is otherwise saying. Indeed, take from
Carlyle his adverbs and one robs him of that great hortatory
sweep which makes him one of the great preachers in English
literature. On the other hand Henry James, although given to
this use to comparable extent, gets a different effect from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
adverbs. With him they are the exponents of scrupulous or
meticulous feeling; they are often in fact words of definite
measure. When James says “fully” or “quickly” or “bravely”
he is usually expressing a definite perception, and sometimes
the adverb will have its own phrasal modifier to give it the
proper direction or limitation of sense. Therefore James’ adverbs,
instead of having a merely expletive force, as do many
of Carlyle’s, tend to integrate themselves with his more objective
description. All this amounts to saying that adverbial
“judgments” can be differently based; and the use of the adverb
will affect a style accordingly.</p>

<p>The caution against presumptuous use of the adjective can
be repeated with somewhat greater force for the adverb. It is
the most tempting of all the parts of speech to question-beg
with. It costs little, for instance, to say “certainly,” “surely,” or
even “terribly,” “awfully,” “undoubtedly”; but it often costs a
great deal to create the picture upon which these words are a
justifiable verdict. Asking the reader to accept them upon the
strength of simple assertion is obviously a form of taking without
earning. We realize that a significant part of every speech
situation is the character of the speaker; and there are characters
who can risk an unproved “certainly” or “undoubtedly.”
They bring to the speech situation a kind of ethical proof
which accentuates their language. Carlyle’s reflective life was
so intense, as we know from <i>Sartor Resartus</i> and other sources,
that it wins for him a certain right to this asseverative style.
As a general rule, though, it will be found that those who are
most entitled to this credit use it least, which is to say, they
prefer to make their demonstrations. We point out in summary
that the adverb is frequently dependent upon the character
of its user, and that, since it is often the qualifier of a qualifier,
it may stand at one more remove from what we have defined
as the primary symbol. This is why beginners should use it
least—should use it only after they have demonstrated that
they can get their results by other means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Verb</i></h3>

<p>The verb is regularly ranked with the noun in force, and it
seems that these two parts of speech express the two aspects
under which we habitually see phenomena, that of determinate
things and that of actions or states of being. Between them
the two divide up the world at a pretty fundamental depth;
and it is a commonplace of rhetorical instruction that a style
made up predominantly of nouns and verbs will be a vigorous
style. These are the symbols of the prime entities, words of
stasis and words of movement (even when the verb is said to
express a “state of being,” we accept that as a kind of modal
action, a process of going on, or having existential quality),
which set forth the broad circumstances of any subject of
discussion. This truth is supported by the facts that the substantive
is the heart of a grammatical subject and the verb
of a grammatical predicate.</p>

<p>When we pass beyond the matter of broad categorization
to look at the verb’s possibilities, we find the greatest need of
instruction to lie in the verb epithet. It may be needless to
impress any literate person with the verb’s relative importance,
but it is necessary to point out, even to some practiced writers,
that the verb itself can modify the action it asserts, or, so to
put it, can carry its own epithet. Looking at the copious supply
of verbs in English, we often find it possible to choose one so
selective in meaning that no adverb is needed to accompany it.
If we wish to assert that “the man moves <i>quickly</i>,” we can say,
depending on the tone of our passage and the general signification,
that he hastens, <i>rushes</i>, <i>flies</i>, <i>scrambles</i>, <i>speeds</i>, <i>tears</i>,
<i>races</i>, <i>bolts</i>, to name only a few. If we wish to assert that a man
is not telling the truth, we have the choice of <i>lies</i>, <i>prevaricates</i>,
<i>falsifies</i>, <i>distorts</i>, <i>exaggerates</i>, and some others. As this may
seem to treat the matter at too didactic a level, let us generalize
by saying that there is such a thing as the characterizing
verb, and that there is no telling how many words could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
been saved, how many passages could have dispensed with a
lumbering and perhaps inaccurate adverb, if this simple truth
about the verb were better appreciated. The best writers of
description and narration know it. Mark Twain’s most vivid
passages are created largely through a frequent and perceptive
use of the verb epithet. Turn to almost any page of <i>Life
on the Mississippi</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ship channels are buoyed and lighted, and therefore it is a comparatively
easy undertaking to learn to run them; clear-water
rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels very gradually,
and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but piloting becomes
another matter when you apply it to vast streams like the
Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave and change
constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose
sand-bars are never at rest, whose channels are forever dodging
and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all
nights and all weathers without the aid of a single lighthouse or a
single buoy, for there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere
in all this three or four thousand miles of villainous river.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here there occurs not just action, but expressive action, to
which something is contributed by Twain’s subtle appreciation
of modal variations in the verb.</p>

<p>There is a rough parallelism between the use of the complex
sentence, with its detail put away in subordinate constructions,
and the use of the verb epithet. In both instances the
user has learned to dispense with a second member of equal
or nearly equal weight in order to get an effect. As the adverbial
qualification is fused with the verb, so in lesser degree,
of course, is the detail of the complex sentence fused
with its principal assertion. These devices of economy and
compression, although they may be carried to a point at which
the style seems forced and unnatural, are among the most
important means of rhetoric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Conjunction</i></h3>

<p>The conjunction, in its simple role as joiner, seems not to
have much character, yet its use expresses of relatedness of
things, which is bound to have signification. As either coordinator
or subordinator of entities, it puts the world into a
condition of mutual relationship through which a large variety
of ideas may be suggested. From the different ways in
which this relationship is expressed, the reader will consciously
and even unconsciously infer different things. Sometimes
the simple “and ... and” coordination is the expression of
childlike mentality, as we saw in our discussion of the compound
sentence. On the other hand, in a different speech
situation it can produce a quite different effect: readers of
the King James version of the Bible are aware of how the
“and” which joins long sequences of verses sets up a kind of
expectancy which is peculiarly in keeping with sacred text.
One gets the feeling from the reiteration of “and” that the
story is confirmed and inevitable; there are no contingencies,
and everything happens with the double assurance of something
foretold. When this pattern is dropped, as it is in a
recent “American” version of the Bible, the text collapses into
a kind of news story.</p>

<p>The frequent use of “but” to join the parts of a compound
sentence seems to indicate a habit of mind. It is found congenial
by those who take a “balanced view,” or who are uneasy
over an assertion until it has been qualified or until some
recognition has been made of its negative. Its influence is in
the direction of the cautious or pedantic style because it makes
this sort of disjunction, whereas “and” generously joins everything
up.</p>

<p>Since conjunctions are usually interpreted as giving the
plot of one’s thought, it is essential to realize that they have
implicit meanings. They usually come at points where a pause
is natural, and there is a temptation, if one may judge by
indulgence in the habit, to lean upon the first one that comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
to mind without reflecting critically upon its significance, so
that although the conjunction may formally connect at this
point, its semantic meaning does not aid in making the connection
precise. A common instance of this fault is the casual
interchange of “therefore” and “thus.” “Therefore” means “in
consequence of,” but “thus” means “in this manner” and
so indicates that some manner has already been described.
“Hence” may take the place of “therefore” but “thus” may not.
“Also” is a connective used with unimaginative regularity by
poor speakers and writers, for whom it seems to signalize the
next thought coming. Yet in precise meaning “also” signifies
only a mechanical sort of addition such as we have in listing
one item after another. To signalize the extension of an idea,
“moreover” is usually more appropriate than “also.” Although
“while” is often used in place of “whereas” to mean “on the
other hand,” it has its other duty of signifying “at the same
time.” “Whereas,” despite its pedantic or legalistic overtone,
will be preferred in passages where precise relationship is the
governing consideration. On the whole it would seem that the
average writer suffers, in the department, from nothing more
than poverty of vocabulary. What he does (what every writer
does to some extent) is to keep on hand a small set of conjunctions
and to use them in a sort of rotation without giving attention
to how their distinctive meanings could further his purpose.</p>

<h3><i>The Preposition</i></h3>

<p>The preposition too is a word expressing relationships, but
this definition gives only a faint idea of its great resources.
When the false rules about the preposition have been set aside,
it is seen that this is a tremendously inventive word. Like the
adverb, it is a free rover, standing almost anywhere; it is constantly
entering into combinations with verbs and nouns, in
which it may direct, qualify, intensify, or even add something
quite new to the meaning; at other times it combines with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
some other preposition to produce an indispensable idiom.
It has given us “get out,” “put over,” “come across,” “eat up,”
“butt in,” “off of,” “in between,” and many other expressions
without which English, especially on the vital colloquial level,
would be poorer indeed. Thornton Wilder maintains that it is
in this extremely free use of the preposition that modern
American English shows its superiority over British English.
Such bold use of prepositional combinations gives to American
English a certain flavor of the grand style, which British
English has not had since the seventeenth century. Melville,
an author working peculiarly on his own, is characterized in
style by this imaginative use of the preposition.</p>

<p>Considered with reference to principle, the preposition
seems to do what the adverb does, but to do it with a kind of
substantive force. “Groundward,” for example, seems weak
beside “toward the ground,” “lengthwise” beside “along the
length of,” or “centrally” beside “in the center of.” The explanation
may well lie in the preposition’s characteristic position;
as a regular orderer of nouns and of verbs, it takes upon
itself something of their solidity of meaning. “What is that
for?” and “Where did you send it to?” lose none of their force
through being terminated by these brief words of relationship.</p>

<h3><i>The Phrase</i></h3>

<p>It will not be necessary to say much about the phrase because
its possibilities have been fairly well covered by our
discussion of the noun and adjective. One qualifying remark
about the force of the prepositional phrase, however,
deserves making. The strength normally found in the preposition
can be greatly diminished by connection with an
abstract noun. That is to say, when the terminus of the preposition
is lacking in vigor or concreteness, the whole expression
may succumb to vagueness, in which cases the single adjective
or adverb will be stronger by comparison. Thus the idea conveyed
by “lazy” is largely frustrated by “of a lazy disposition”;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that of “mercenary” by “of a mercenary character”; that of
“deep” by “of depth,” and so on.</p>

<p>After the prepositional phrase, the most important phrasal
combination to examine, from the standpoint of rhetorical
usages, is the participial phrase. We could infer this truth from
the fact alone that the Greeks made a very extensive use of
the participle, as every student of that marvellous language
knows. Greek will frequently use a participle where English
employs a dependent clause or even a full sentence, so that
the English expression “the man who is carrying a spear”
would be in Greek “the spear carrying man”; “the one who
spoke” would be “the one having spoken” and further accordingly,
with even more economy of language than these
examples indicate. I am disposed to think that the Greeks
developed this habit because they were very quick to see
opportunities of subordination. The clarity and subtlety of
the Greek language derives in no small part from this highly
“organized” character, in which auxiliary thoughts are compactly
placed in auxiliary structures, where they permit the
central thought to emerge more readily. In English the auxiliary
status of the participle (recognized formally through its
classification as an adjective) is not always used to like advantage.</p>

<p>One consequence of this is that although English intonation
and normal word order tend to make the last part of a sentence
the most emphatic, unskillful writers sometimes lose this emphasis
by concluding a sentence with a participial phrase. We
may take as examples “He returned home in September, having
been gone for a year”; and “Having been gone for a year,
he returned home in September.” The second of these puts
the weightier construction in the emphatic position. Of course
the matter of their relative merit cannot be separated from
their purpose; there are sentences whose total meanings are
best served by a <i>retardo</i> or <i>diminuendo</i> effect at the end, and
for such closes the participial phrase is well suited for reasons
already given. But in the majority of utterances it contributes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
best by modifying at some internal position, or by expressing
some detail or some condition at the beginning of the sentence.
The latter use may be quite effective in climactic orderings,
and it will be found that journalists have virtually stereotyped
this opening for their “lead” sentences: “Threatened
with an exhausted food supply by the strike, hospitals today
made special arrangements for the delivery of essentials”;
“Reaching a new high for seven weeks, the stock market yesterday
pushed into new territory.” This form is a successful
if often crude result of effort toward compact and dramatic
presentation.</p>

<p>But to summarize our observations on the participial phrase
in English: It is formally a weak member of the grammatical
family; but it is useful for economy, for shaded effects, and
sometimes the phrase will contain words whose semantic
force makes us forget that they are in a secondary construction.
Perhaps it is enough to say that the mature writer has
learned more things that can be done with the participle, but
has also learned to respect its limitations.</p>

<h3><i>In Conclusion</i></h3>

<p>I can imagine being told that this chapter is nothing more
than an exposition of prejudices, and that every principle discussed
here can be defied. I would not be surprised if that
were proved through single examples, or small sets of examples.
But I would still hazard that if these show certain tendencies,
my examples show stronger ones, and we have to
remember that there is such a thing as a vector of forces in
language too. Even though an effect may sometimes be obtained
by crowding or even breaking a rule, the lines of force
are still there, to be used by the skillful writer scientifically,
and grammar is a kind of scientific nomenclature. Beyond this,
of course, he will use them according to art, where he will be
guided by his artistic intuition, and by the residual cautions
of his experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>In the long view a due respect for the canons of grammar
seems a part of one’s citizenship? One does not remain uncritical;
but one does “go along.” It has proved impossible to
show that grammar is determined by the “best people,” or by
the pedants, or by any other presumptive authority, and this
is more reason for saying that it incorporates the people as a
whole. Therefore the attitude of unthinking adoption and the
attitude of personal defiance are both dubious, because they
look away from the point where issues, whenever they appear,
will be decided. That point seems to be some communal sense
about the fitness of a word or a construction for what has
communal importance, and this indicates at least some suprapersonal
basis. Much evidence could be offered to show that
language is something which is born psychological but is ever
striving to become logical. At this task of making it more
logical everybody works more or less. Like the political citizenship
defined by Aristotle, language citizenship makes one a
potential magistrate, or one empowered to decide. The work
is best carried on, however, by those who are aware that language
must have some connection with the intelligential
world, and that is why one must think about the rhetorical
nature even of grammatical categories.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VI">Chapter VI<br />
MILTON’S HEROIC PROSE</h2>

</div>

<p>There are many who have wished that Milton were
living at this hour, but not all have taken into account
the fact that his great polemical writings demand
an heroic kind of attention which modern education does not
discipline the majority of our citizens to give. Even in the last
century W. E. Channing was moved to lament “the fastidiousness
and effeminacy of modern readers” when faced with
Milton’s prose writings. He went on to say, in a passage which
may serve to introduce our topic, “To be universally intelligible
is not the highest merit. A great mind cannot, without
injurious constraint, shrink itself to the grasp of common passive
readers.” It is wrong therefore to expect it to sacrifice
great qualities “that the multitude may keep pace with it.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The situation which gave rise to Channing’s complaint has
grown measurably worse by our day, when the common passive
reader determines the level of most publications. The
mere pursuance of Milton’s meaning requires an enforcement
of attention, and the perception of his judgments requires an
active sensibility incompatible with a state of relaxation.
There is nothing in Milton for the reader who must be put at
ease and treated only to the quickly apprehensible. But along
with this turning away from the difficult, there is another cause
at work, a feeling, quite truly grounded, that Milton’s very
arduousness of spirit calls for elevation on the part of the
reader. Milton assumes an heroic stance, and he demands a
similar stance of those who would meet him. An age which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
has come to suspect this as evidence of aristocratic tendency
will then avoid Milton also for a moral reason, preferring, even
when it agrees with him, to have the case stated in more
plebeian fashion. Therefore the reading of Milton is more than
a problem in communication; it is a problem also of gaining
insight, or even of developing sympathy with the aristocratic
intellectualism which breathes through all he wrote.</p>

<p>It can be shown that all of the features which make up
Milton’s arduous style proceed from three or four sources.
The first of these is the primacy of the concept. What this primacy
signifies is that in his prose Milton wrote primarily as a
thinker and not as an artificer. That is to say, his units of composition
are built upon concepts and not upon conventionalized
expository patterns. For him the linguistic sentence was
a means, to be expanded and shaped as the driving force of
the thought required. Or perhaps it would be more meaningful
to say that for him the sentence was an accommodation-form.
He will put into it as much or as little as he needs, and
often, as we shall see presently, he needed a great deal. This
use of the sentence as an accommodation-form produces what
is perhaps the most obvious feature of his style, the long
period. What length must a sentence have to be called “long”?
Of course our usual standard is the sentence we are accustomed
to, and in present-day writing that sentence will run
20-30 words, to cite an average range for serious writing.
Milton’s sentences very frequently run 60-80 words, and many
will exceed 100, the length of an average paragraph today.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>To examine Milton’s method with the lengthy period, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
may well begin with the second sentence of <i>Of Reformation in
England</i>, an outstanding specimen of 373 words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sad it is to think how that doctrine of the gospel, planted by
teachers divinely inspired, and by them winnowed and sifted from
the chaff of overdated ceremonies, and refined to such a spiritual
height and temper of purity, and knowledge of the Creator, that
the body, with all the circumstances of time and place, were purified
by the affections of the regenerate soul, and nothing left impure
but sin; faith needing not the weak and fallible office of the
senses, to be either the ushers or interpreters of heavenly mysteries,
save where our Lord himself in his sacraments ordained; that such
a doctrine should, through the grossness and blindness of her professors,
and the fraud of deceivable traditions, drag so downwards,
as to backslide into the Jewish beggary of old cast rudiments, and
stumble forward another way into the new-vomited paganism of
sensual idolatry, attributing purity or impurity to things indifferent,
that they might bring the inward acts of the spirit to the outward
and customary eye-service of the body, as if they could make
God earthly and fleshly, because they could not make themselves
heavenly and spiritual; they began to draw down all the divine
intercourse between God and the soul, yea, the very shape of God
himself, into an exterior and bodily form, urgently pretending a
necessity and obligement of joining the body in a formal reverence,
and worship circumscribed; they hallowed it, they fumed it, they
sprinkled it, they bedecked it, not in robes of pure innocency, but
of pure linen, with other deformed and fantastic dresses, in palls
and mitres, gold and gewgaws fetched from Aaron’s old wardrobe,
or the flamins vestry: then was the priest set to con his motions and
his postures, his liturgies and his lurries, till the soul by this means
of overbodying herself, given up justly to fleshly delights, bated
her wing apace downward: and finding the ease she had from her
visible and sensuous colleague the body, in performance of religious
duties, her pinions now broken, and flagging, shifted off from
herself the labor of high soaring any more, forgot her heavenly
flight, and left the dull and droiling carcase to plod in the old road,
and drudging trade of outward conformity.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>With reference to accommodation, let us attend to the scope
of this sentence. It contains nothing less than a history of
Christianity from the Protestant reformer’s point of view. Four
stages are given in this history: the early revelation of true
Christianity; its later misinterpretation through the “grossness
and blindness” of its followers; the growth of institutionalism;
and finally the atrophy of true religion produced by undue
attention to outward circumstance. It is, as we see, a
complete narration, dressed out with many illuminating details.
We shall discover that Milton habitually prolongs a
sentence thus until it has covered the unit of its subject. He
feels no compulsion to close the period out of regard for some
established norm, since he has his eye on a different criterion
of completeness. In line with the same practice, some of his
sentences are so fitted that they contain complete arguments,
or even an argument preceded by its expository narration. As
an example of the sentence containing a unit of argument, we
may note the following from <i>The Doctrine and Discipline of
Divorce</i>.</p>

<p><i>And yet there follows upon this a worse temptation: for if he be
such as hath spent his youth unblameably, and laid up his chiefest
earthly comforts in the enjoyments of a contented marriage, nor
did neglect that furtherance which was to be obtained therein by
constant prayers; when he shall find himself bound fast to an uncomplying
discord of nature, or, as it often happens, to an image
of earth and phlegm, with whom he looked to be the copartner of
a sweet and gladsome society, and sees withal that his bondage is
now inevitable; though he be almost the strongest Christian, he
will be ready to despair in virtue, and mutiny against Divine
Providence; and this doubtless is the reason of those lapses, and
that melancholy despair, which we see in many wedded persons,
though they understand it not, or pretend other causes, because
they know no remedy; and is of extreme danger: therefore when
human frailty surcharged is at such a loss, charity ought to venture
much, lest an overtossed faith endanger to shipwreck.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
This sentence contains a complete hypothetical syllogism,
which can be abstracted as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If the rigidity of the marriage relationship is not relaxed by
charity, Christians will despair of finding their solace in that
relationship.</p>

<p>The rigidity of the marriage relationship is not at present relaxed
by charity.</p>

<p>Christians do despair of finding solace within that relationship
(as shown by “those lapses and that melancholy despair, which
we see in many wedded persons”).</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the argument prescribes the content of the sentence and
marshals it.</p>

<p>Let us look next at a specimen from the <i>Areopagitica</i> embodying
not only the full syllogism but also a preparatory
exposition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When a man writes to the world, he summons up all his reason
and deliberation to assist him; he searches, meditates, is industrious,
and likely consults and confers with his judicious friends;
after all which done, he takes himself to be informed in what he
writes, as well as any that writ before him; if in this most consummate
act of his fidelity and ripeness, no years, no industry, no former
proof of his abilities can bring him to that state of maturity,
as not to be still mistrusted and suspected, unless he carry all his
considerate diligence, all his midnight watchings, and expense of
Palladian oil, to the hasty view of an unleisured licenser, perhaps
much his younger, perhaps far his inferior in judgment, perhaps
one who never knew the labor of bookwriting; and if he be not
repulsed, or slighted, must appear in print like a puny with his
guardian, and his censor’s hand on the back of his title to be his
bail and surety, that he is no idiot or seducer; it cannot be but a
dishonor and derogation the author, to the book, to the privilege
and dignity of learning.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>In this utterance of 197 words, every detail pertains to the
one concept of the responsibility and dignity of learning; yet
closer inspection reveals that a two-part structure is accommodated.
First there is the “narration,” a regular part of the
classical oration, here setting forth the industry and conscientiousness
of authors. This is followed by a hypothetical
argument saying, in effect, that if all these guarantees of sober
and honest performance are not enough to entitle authors to
liberty, there can be no respect for learning or learned men
in the commonwealth. Thus the sentence is prolonged, one
might say, until the speech is made, and the speech is not a
series of loosely related assertions but a structure defined by
standard principles of logic and rhetoric.</p>

<p>Apart from mere length, which as Whatley and other writers
on style observe, imposes a burden upon the memory too
great to be expected of everyone, there is in the longer Miltonic
sentence the additional tax of complexity. Of course
Milton was somewhat influenced by Latin grammar, but here
we are less interested in measuring literary influences than in
analyzing the reading problem which he presents in our day.
That problem is created largely by his intricate elaboration
within the long period. For an especially apt illustration of
this I should like to return to <i>Of Reformation in England</i> and
follow the sentence which introduces that work.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Amidst those deep and retired thoughts, which, with every man
Christianly instructed, ought to be most frequent, of God and of
his miraculous ways and works among men, and of our religion
and works, to be performed to him; after the story of our Saviour
Christ, suffering to the lowest bent of weakness in the flesh, and
presently triumphing to the highest pitch of glory in the spirit,
which drew up his body also; till we in both be united to him in the
revelation of his kingdom, I do not know of anything more worthy
to take up the whole passion of pity on the one side, and joy on
the other, than to consider first the foul and sudden corruption,
and then, after many a tedious age, the long deferred, but much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
more wonderful and happy reformation of the church in these
latter days.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be agreed, I feel, that the following features require a
more than ordinary effort of attention and memory: (1) The
rhetorical interruptions, whereby <i>which</i> is separated from its
verb <i>ought to be</i>, and <i>thoughts</i> is separated from its prepositional
modifier <i>of God and of his miraculous works and ways
among men</i>.—(2) The progressive particularization of <i>our
Saviour Christ</i>, wherein the substantive is modified by two
participial constructions, <i>suffering to the lowest bent of weakness
in the flesh</i> and <i>triumphing to the highest pitch of glory
in the spirit</i>; wherein again the substantive <i>spirit</i> takes a modifier
in the clause <i>which drew up his body also</i>, and the verb
<i>drew up</i> of the clause is qualified by the adverbial clause <i>till
we in both be united to him in the revelation of his kingdom</i>.
This is a type of elaboration in which, as the account unfolds,
each detail seems to require a gloss, which is offered in a construction
of some weight or length.—(3) The extensive parallelism
of the last part, beginning with <i>the whole passion of pity
on the one side</i>.—(4) The suspended structure which withholds
the topic phrase of the tract, <i>happy reformation of the church</i>,
until almost the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>All of these qualities of length, scope, and complexity made
the Miltonic sentence a formidable construction, and we are
curious to know why he was able to use it with public success.
The first circumstance we must take into account is that he
lived in a tough-minded period of Western culture. It was a
time when the foundations of the state were being searched
out; when the relationship between religion and political authority
was being re-defined, to the disregard of old customs;
and when sermons were powerful arguments, beginning with
first principles and moving down through a long chain of
deductions. It was a time in which every thinking man virtually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
had to be either a revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary;
and there is something in such intellectual climate
which scorns prettification and mincing measure. The public
therefore met Milton’s impassioned interest with an equal
passion. But by public we do not mean here the half-educated
masses of today; Milton’s public was rather a sternly educated
minority, which had been taught to recognize an argument
when it saw one, and even to analyze its source.</p>

<p>Further evidence of the absorbing interest in the argumentative
burden of prose expression may be seen in the way he
employs the extended metaphor. Milton grew up in the age
of the metaphysical conceit. We now understand that for
Elizabethans and Jacobeans a metaphor went far beyond
mere ornamentation to enter into the very heart of a predication.
Rosemund Tuve in particular has shown that for the
poets of the period an image was an argument, so understood
and so used.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> We would hardly expect it to be any less so in
prose. When Milton brings in a metaphor, he makes full use
of its probative value, and this involved, along with confidence
in the architectonic power of the image, a belief that it affirmed
something about the case in point. Thus the metaphor
was not idle or decorative merely, and it dominated the passage
to the eclipse of sentence units. This will explain why,
when Milton begins a metaphor, he will scarcely abandon it
until the last appropriate application has been made and the
similitude established beyond reasonable question.</p>

<p>The <i>Areopagitica</i> teems with brilliant extended figures, of
which two will be cited. Here is an image of truth, carried
through three sentences.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Truth indeed came once into the world with her divine master,
and was a perfect shape most glorious to look on: but when he
had ascended, and his apostles after him were laid asleep, then
straight arose a wicked race of deceivers, who, as that story goes of
the Egyptian Typhon with his conspirators, how they dealt with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the good Osiris, took the virgin Truth, hewed her lovely form into
a thousand pieces, and scattered them to the four winds. From
that time ever since, the sad friends of Truth, such as durst appear,
imitating the careful search that Isis made after the body of Osiris,
went up and down gathering limb by limb still as they could find
them. We have not found them all, lords and commons, nor ever
shall do, till her master’s second coming; he shall bring together
every joint and member, and shall mold them into an immortal
feature of loveliness and perfection. Suffer not these licensing prohibitions
to stand at every place of opportunity forbidding and disturbing
them that continue seeking, that continue to do our obsequies
to the torn body of our martyred saint.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And here is Milton’s defense of the intellectually free community,
rendered in a military metaphor.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>First, when a city shall be as it were besieged and blocked about,
her navigable river infested, inroads and incursions round, defiance
and battle oft rumored to be marching up, even to her walls
and suburb trenches; that then the people, or the greater part,
more than at other times, wholly taken up with the study of highest
and most important matters to be reformed, should be disputing,
reasoning, reading, inventing, discoursing, even to a rarity and
admiration, things not before discoursed or written of, argues first
a singular good will, contentedness, and confidence in your prudent
foresight, and safe government, lords and commons; and from
thence derives itself to a gallant bravery and well grounded contempt
of their enemies, as if there were no small number of as
great spirits among us, as was his who, when Rome was nigh besieged
by Hannibal, being in the city, bought that piece of ground
at no cheap rate, whereupon Hannibal himself encamped his own
regiment.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Milton’s concept of church government according to Scripture
is thus presented in <i>The Reason of Church Government Urged
Against Prelaty</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Did God take such delight in measuring out the pillars, arches,
and doors of a material temple? Was he so punctual and circumspect
in lavers, altars and sacrifices soon after to be abrogated, lest
any of these should have been made contrary to his mind? Is not
a far more perfect work, more agreeable to his perfections, in the
most perfect state of the church militant, the new alliance to God
to man? Should not he rather now by his own prescribed discipline
have cast his line and level upon the soul of man, which is his rational
temple, and, by the divine square and compass thereof, form
and regenerate in us the lovely shapes of virtues and graces, the
sooner to edify and accomplish that immortal stature of Christ’s
body, which is his church, in all her glorious lineaments and proportions?<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What we are especially called upon to note in these examples
is the boldness of figuration, by which the concept survives
the pressure of many, and sometimes rather concrete, tests of
correspondence, as the analogy enlarges. The author’s faith in
the figure as an organizing principle is likely evidence that he
sees the world as form, the more of which can be drawn out
the better. To a later day, any figure carried beyond modest
length runs the danger of turning into an ironic commentary
upon its analogue, but to Milton, as to the seventeenth century
generally, it was a window to look through. Now quite literally
the conceit is a concept, and we have found it to be another
organizing medium of this intellectual prose, and a second
proof that some texture of thought precedes the mere linguistic
expression, and holds itself superior to it.</p>

<p>While the primacy of the concept is responsible for these
formal features of style, we must look elsewhere for the source
of its vigor. Certainly another reason that Milton is a taxing
author to read is the restless energy that permeates his substance.
He never allows the reader to remain inert, and this is
because there were few things toward which Milton himself
was indifferent. One revelation of the active mind is the zeal
and completeness with which it sorts things according to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
scale of values; and judged by that standard Milton’s mind is
active in the extreme. To approach this a little more systematically,
what one discovers with one’s first reading of the prose
is that Milton is constantly attentive to the degrees of things,
and his range of valuations, extending from those things which
can be described only through his elegant curses to those
which require the language of religious or poetic eulogy, is
very great. Indeed, “things indifferent,” to employ a phrase
used by Milton himself, play a very small part in his writing,
which rather tends to be juridical in the highest measure. And
the vitality contributed by this awareness of difference he increased
by widening the gulf between the bad and the good.
These contrarieties are managed in various ways: sometimes
they are made up of single nouns of opposed meaning; sometimes
of other parts of speech or of phrases; but always it
would take a dull reader to miss the opposed valuations. A
sentence from The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce will
afford some good examples.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hence it is, that error supports custom, custom countenances
error: and these two between them would persecute and chase
away all truth and solid wisdom out of human life, were it not that
God, rather than man, once in many ages calls together the prudent
and religious counsels of men, deputed to repress the encroachments,
and to work off the inveterate blots and obscurities wrought
upon our minds by the subtle insinuating of error and custom; who,
with the numerous and vulgar train of their followers, make it their
chief design to envy and cry down the industry of free reasoning,
under the terms of humor and innovation; as if the womb of teeming
truth were to be closed up, if she presume to bring forth aught
that sorts not with their unchewed notions and suppositions.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The vigor of this passage arises from a continuing series of
contrasts, comprising the following: <i>error and custom</i> with
<i>truth and solid wisdom; God</i> with <i>man</i>; <i>prudent and religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
counsels</i> with <i>encroachments</i> and also with <i>inveterate blots
and obscurities; subtle insinuating of error and custom</i> with
<i>industry of free reasoning</i>; and <i>womb of teeming truth</i> with
<i>unchewed notions and suppositions</i>.</p>

<p>Here is another passage, from <i>Of Reformation in England</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>So that in this manner the prelates, both then and ever since,
coming from a mean and plebeian life on a sudden to be lords of
stately palaces, rich furniture, delicious fare, and princely attendance,
thought the plain and homespun verity of Christ’s gospel
unfit any longer to hold their lordships’ acquaintance, unless the
poor threadbare matron were put into better clothes; her chaste
and modest vail, surrounded with celestial beams, they overlaid
with wanton tresses, and in a staring tire bespeckled her with all
the gaudy allurements of a whore.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this the clash is between <i>plebeian life</i> and <i>stately palaces</i>,
<i>rich furniture</i>, etc.; <i>homespun verity</i> and <i>lordship’s acquaintance</i>;
<i>threadbare matron</i> and <i>better clothes</i>; <i>chaste and
modest vail</i> and <i>wanton tresses</i>, <i>staring tire</i>, and <i>gaudy allurements
of a whore</i>. Lastly I should like to take a sentence from
the same work, which has been admired by Aldous Huxley
for its energy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thus then did the spirit of unity and meekness inspire and animate
every joint and sinew of the mystical body; but now the
gravest and worthiest minister, a true bishop of his fold, shall be
reviled and ruffled by an insulting and only canon-wise prelate,
as if he were some slight paltry companion: and the people of God,
redeemed and washed with Christ’s blood, and dignified with so
many glorious titles of saints and sons in the gospel, are now no
better reputed than impure ethnics and lay dogs; stones, pillars,
and crucifixes, have now the honour and the alms due to Christ’s
living members; the table of communion, now become a table of
separation, stands like an exalted platform on the brow of the
quire, fortified with bulwark and barricado, to keep off the profane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
touch of the laics, whilst the obscene and surfeited priest scruples
not to paw and mammock the sacramental bread as familiarly as
his tavern biscuit.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this typical specimen of Milton’s vehemence, <i>gravest and
worthiest minister, a true bishop</i> contrasts with <i>insulting and
only canon-wise prelate</i> and with <i>slight paltry companion</i>;
<i>the people of God, redeemed and washed with Christ’s blood,
and dignified with so many glorious titles of saints and sons
in the gospel</i> with <i>impure ethnics</i> and <i>lay dogs</i>; <i>stones, pillars,
and crucifixes</i> with <i>Christ’s living members</i>; <i>communion</i> with
<i>separation</i>; <i>fortified with bulwark and barricado</i> with the
earlier <i>unity and meekness</i>; <i>obscene</i>, <i>surfeited</i>, <i>paw</i>, and
<i>mammock</i> with <i>priest</i>; and <i>sacramental bread</i> with <i>tavern
biscuit</i>.</p>

<p>The effect of such sustained contrast is to produce a high
degree of tonicity, and here in a word is why Milton’s prose
seems never relaxed. His pervading consciousness of the combat
of good and evil caused him to engage in constant projections
of that combat. In a manner of speaking, Milton always
writes from a “prejudice,” which proves to be on inspection his
conviction as a Christian and as a political and moral preacher,
that, as the good has been judged, the duty of a publicist is to
show it separated with the utmost clearness of distinction from
the bad. Accordingly Milton’s expositions, if one follows them
intently, cause one to accept one thing and reprobate another
unceasingly.</p>

<p>In consequence there appears in many passages a quality
of style which I shall call the superlative mode. His very
reaching out toward the two extremes of a gauge of value
drives him to couch expression in terms raised to their highest
degree. Often we see this in the superlative form of the adjective.
But we see it also in his employment of words which
even in their grammatically positive forms have acquired a
kind of superlative sense. Finally we see it on occasion in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
pattern of incremental repetition which he uses to impress us
with his most impassioned thoughts. The wonderful closing
prayer from <i>Of Reformation in England</i> contains examples of
all of these superlatives. Here are the closing paragraphs.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And now we know, O thou our most certain hope and defence,
that thine enemies have been consulting all the sorceries of the
great whore, and have joined their plots with that sad intelligencing
tyrant that mischiefs the world with his mines of Ophir, and lies
thirsting to revenge his naval ruins that have larded our seas: but
let them all take counsel together, and let it come to nought; let
them decree, and do thou cancel it; let them gather themselves,
and be scattered; let them embattle themselves, and be broken,
for thou art with us.</p>

<p>Then, amidst the hymns and hallelujahs of saints, some one may
perhaps be heard offering at high strains in new and lofty measures,
to sing and celebrate thy divine mercies and marvellous
judgments in this land throughout all ages; whereby this great and
warlike nation, instructed and inured to the fervent and continual
practice of truth and righteousness, and casting far from her the rags
of her old vices, may press on hard to that high and happy emulation
to be found the soberest, wisest, and most Christian people
at that day, when thou, the eternal and shortly-expected King, shalt
open the clouds to judge the several kingdoms of the world, and
distributing national honours and rewards to religious and just
commonwealths, shalt put an end to all earthly tyrannies, proclaiming
thy universal and mild monarchy through heaven and
earth; where they undoubtedly, that by their labors, counsels and
prayers, have been earnest for the common good of religion and
their country, shall receive above the inferior orders of the blessed,
the regal addition of principalities, legions, and thrones into their
glorious titles, and in supereminence of beatific vision, progressing
the dateless and irrevoluble circle of eternity, shall clasp inseparable
hands with joy and bliss, in overmeasure, for ever.</p>

<p>But they contrary, that by the impairing and diminution of the
true faith, the distresses and servitude of their country, aspire to
high dignity, rule, and promotion here, after a shameful end in this
life (which God grant them), shall be thrown down eternally into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the darkest and deepest gulf of hell, where under the despiteful
control, the trample and spurn of all the other damned, that in the
anguish of their torture, shall have no other ease than to exercise
a raving and bestial tyranny over them as their slaves and negroes,
they shall remain in that plight for ever, the basest, the lowermost,
the most dejected, most underfoot, and downtrodden vassals of
perdition.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Let us mark the bristling superlatives. Of adjectives in superlative
form we find <i>most certain</i>, <i>soberest</i>, <i>wisest</i>, <i>most
Christian</i>, <i>darkest</i>, <i>deepest</i>, <i>basest</i>, <i>lowermost</i>, <i>most dejected</i>,
<i>most underfoot</i>, and <i>[most] downtrodden</i>. Of those words
which have a superlative force or meaning, I would list—allowing
that this must be a matter of judgment—<i>naught</i>, <i>cancel</i>,
<i>broken</i>, <i>marvellous</i>, <i>fervent</i>, <i>eternal</i>, <i>universal</i>, <i>undoubtedly</i>,
<i>supereminence</i>, <i>beatific</i>, <i>dateless</i>, <i>irrevoluble</i>, <i>eternity</i>, <i>inseparable</i>,
<i>overmeasure</i>, <i>for ever</i>, and <i>eternally</i>. But the most
interesting form of the superlative mode is the pattern of repetition
by which Milton, through a progressive accumulation of
substantives and adjectives, builds up a crescendo. First there
will be one or more groups of two, then perhaps a group of
three, and finally, for the supreme effect, a breathtaking collocation
of five. Such a pattern appears in the concluding sentence
of the prayer: <i>impairing</i> and <i>diminution</i>; <i>distresses</i> and
<i>servitude</i>; <i>dignity</i>, <i>rule</i>, and <i>promotion</i>; <i>darkest</i> and <i>deepest</i>;
<i>control</i>, <i>trample</i>, and <i>spurn</i>; <i>raving</i> and <i>bestial</i>; <i>slaves</i> and
<i>negroes</i>; <i>basest</i>, <i>lowermost</i>, <i>most dejected</i>, <i>most underfoot and
downtrodden</i>. Here, it will be noticed, the sequence is 2-2-3-2-3-2-2-5.
The pattern in itself is revealing. First there are
two pairs which ready us for attaining the group of three;
then another pair to rest upon before we attain the group of
three again; then two more pairs for a longer respite while we
ready ourselves for the supreme effort of the group of five.</p>

<p>The prayer is not, of course, an ordinary passage; yet what
is seen here is discoverable in some measure in all of Milton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
prose. He wrote in this superlative vein because his principal
aim was the divorcement of good and evil. To show these wide
apart, he had to talk in terms of best and worst, and being a
rhetorician of vast resources, he found ways of making the
superlative even more eminent than our regular grammatical
forms make it, which naturally marks him as a great creative
user of the language.</p>

<p>The topic of grouping appropriately introduces another
aspect of Milton’s style which I shall refer to more specifically
as systematic collocation. No one can read him with the object
of forming some descriptive image of his prose without being
impressed by his frequent use of pairs of words similar in
meaning to express a single object or idea. These pairs will be
comprised, in a roughly equal number of instances, of nouns
and of adjectives, though fairly often two verbs will make up
the collocation and occasionally two adverbs. It seems probable
that these pairs, more than any other single feature of the
style, give the impression of thickness, which is in turn the
source of the impression of strength. Or to present this in another
way, what the pairs create is the effect of dimension. It
needs no proving at this stage that Milton had too well stored a
mind and too genuine a passion to coast along on mere fluency.
If he used two words where another author would use one, that
fact affords presumption that his second word had its margin
of meaningful addition to contribute. And so we find it: these
pairs of substantives give his prose a dimensional quality, because
this one will show one aspect of the thing named and
that one another. It would require a rather long list to include
the variety of aspects which Milton will bring out by his practice
of double naming; sometimes it is in form and substance,
or the conceptual and the material nature of the thing; sometimes
it is appearance and meaning; sometimes process and
tendency; sometimes one modifier will express the active and
another the passive nature of the thing described. Always the
practice causes his subject matter to convey this sensation of
depth and realness, which is a principal factor in the vitality
of his style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>We shall look at some examples of this highly interesting
method. The first is from the <i>Areopagitica</i>. I have italicized
the pairs.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Methinks I see in my mind a <i>noble</i> and <i>puissant</i> nation rousing
herself like a strong man after a sleep, and shaking her invincible
locks: methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and
kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam, <i>purging</i> and
<i>unscaling</i> her long abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly
radiance; while the whole noise of <i>timorous</i> and <i>flocking</i> birds,
with those also that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what
she means, and in their envious gabble, would prognosticate a year
of <i>sects</i> and <i>schisms</i>.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Noble</i> and <i>puissant</i> direct attention to ethical and to physical
attributes; <i>purging</i> and <i>scaling</i> do not form so complementary
a pair but perhaps denote two distinct phases of a process;
<i>timorous</i> and <i>flocking</i> is an excellent pair to show inward nature
and outward behavior, and must be accounted one of the
most successful uses of the method; <i>sects</i> and <i>schisms</i> would
seem to refer to social or ecclesiastical and to theological aspects
of division.</p>

<p>In a sentence from <i>Of Reformation in England</i>, he says:
“But what do I stand reckoning upon <i>advantages</i> and <i>gains</i>
lost by the <i>misrule</i> and <i>turbulency</i> of the prelates?”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> <i>Advantages</i>
and <i>gains</i> stand for two sorts of progress made prior to
the <i>misrule</i> and <i>turbulency</i> of the prelates, which in turn signify
the formal outward policies and the inner spirit of ambition
and presumption. From the <i>Doctrine and Discipline of
Divorce</i>: “The <i>ignorance</i> and <i>mistake</i> of this high point hath
heaped up one huge half of all the misery that hath been since
Adam.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Here <i>ignorance</i> would seem to describe a passive
lack of awareness, whereas <i>mistake</i> describes active misapprehension
or misapplication. Finally here are examples from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
<i>Animadversions upon the Remonstrant’s Defence Against
Smectymnuus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We all know that in <i>private</i> or <i>personal</i> injuries, yea, in public
sufferings for the cause of Christ, his <i>rule</i> and <i>example</i> teaches us
to be so far from a readiness to speak evil, as not to answer the
reviler in his language, though never so much provoked: yet in the
<i>detecting</i> and <i>convincing</i> of any notorious enemy to <i>truth</i> and his
<i>country’s peace</i>, especially that is conceited to have a <i>voluble</i> and
<i>smart</i> fluence of tongue, and in the vain confidence of that, and out
of a more tenacious cling to worldly respects, stands up for all the
rest to justify a <i>long usurpation</i> and <i>convicted pseudepiscopy</i> of
prelates, with all their ceremonies, liturgies and tyrannies, which
<i>God</i> and <i>man</i> are now ready to <i>explode</i> and <i>hiss out of the land</i>:
I suppose, and more than suppose, it will be nothing disagreeing
from Christian meekness to handle such a one in a rougher accent,
and to send home his haughtiness well bespurted with his own
holy water.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here <i>private</i> and <i>personal</i> may be taken as giving us two
aspects of the individual; <i>rule</i> and <i>example</i> differ as abstract
and concrete; <i>detecting</i> and <i>convincing</i> (the latter apparently
in the older sense of “overcoming”) denote two stages of a
process; <i>truth</i> and <i>his country’s peace</i> may be taken to express
the metaphysical and the embodied forms of the same thing;
<i>voluble</i> and <i>smart</i> seem to refer to what is perceivable by the
senses and by the intellect respectively; <i>long usurpation</i> and
<i>convicted pseudepiscopy</i> differ as simple action and action
which has been judged: <i>God</i> and <i>man</i> bring together the divine
and the human; <i>explode</i> and <i>hiss out of the land</i> again
express two stages of a process.</p>

<p>In the manner here indicated, these collocations serve to
give the style a wonderful richness of thought. The reader feels
that he is being shown both the <i>esse</i> and the <i>potesse</i> of the
object named. At least, he gets a look at its manifold nature.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
The way in which Milton fills out the subject for his reader is
at once lavish and perspicuous. Just as his figures were seen to
have a prolonged correspondence, beyond what the casual or
unthinking writer would bring to view, so his substantives and
predicates are assembled upon a principle of penetration or
depth of description.</p>

<p>Our general impression of Milton—an impression we get in
some degree of all the great writers of his period and of the
Elizabethan period before it—is that his thought dominates
the medium. While the distinction between what is said and
the form of saying it can never be drawn absolutely, it is yet
to be remarked that some writers seem to compose with an
awareness of how their matter will look upon the page, or how
it will sound in the parlor; others seem to keep their main attention
upon currently preferred terms and idioms. Again, some
writers seem to accept the risk of suspension, transposition,
and involution out of conscious elegance; Milton seems rather
to require them out of strength of purpose. He was not a writer
of writing, but consistently a writer of substance, and the language
was his instrumentality, which he used with the familiar
boldness of a master. One would go far to find a better illustration
of the saying of John Peale Bishop that the English language
is like a woman; it is most likely to yield after one has
shown it a little violence. All of the great prose writers of the
Elizabethan age and the Seventeenth century were perfectly
capable of showing it that violence, and I believe this is the
true reason that a lover of eloquence today reacts their works
with irrepressible admiration. The tremendous suspensions
and ramifications they were willing to create; their readiness
to make function the test of grammar and to coin according
to need, through all of which a rational, though not always a
formal or codified syntax survives—these things bespeak a
sort of magisterial attitude toward language which has been
lost in the intervening centuries.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that long years of accumulated usage
tend to act as a deterrent to a free and imaginative use of language.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
So many stereotypes have had time to form themselves,
and so many manuals of usage have been issued that the choice
would seem to lie between simple compliance and open rebellion.
Either one uses the language as the leaders of one’s social
and business world use it, or one makes a decisive break and
uses it in open defiance of the conventionalized patterns. We
may remember in this connection that when the new movement
in modern literature got underway in the second decade
of this century, its leaders proved themselves the most defiant
and brash kind of rebels as they embarked upon the work of
resuscitation and refurbishment, and it was to the Elizabethans
especially that they looked for sanction and guidance.
But the rebel with this program faces a dilemma: he cannot
infuse life into the old forms that he knows are depriving expression
of all vitality, and he exhausts himself in the campaign
to smash and get rid of them.</p>

<p>That is partly an historical observation, and our interest is
in laying bare the movement of a great eloquence. Yet if we
had to answer whether some heroic style like that of Milton
cannot be formed for our own day, when millions might rejoice
to hear a sonorous voice speaking out of a deep learning
in our traditions, our answer would surely be, yes. And if
asked how, we would begin our counsel by telling the writer
to heed the advice in Emerson’s <i>American Scholar</i>—better indeed
than Emerson heeded it himself—to look upon himself
not as a writer but as a man writing, and to try to live in that
character. As long as one does that, it is most likely that the
concept will dominate the medium, and that one will use,
with inventive freedom, such conventionality as is necessary
to language. A timid correctness, like perfect lucidity, sometimes
shows that more attention has been devoted to the form
than to the thought, and this may give the writing a kind of
hard surface which impedes sympathy between writer and
reader. Finally, one should remember that people like to feel
they are hearing of the solid fact and substance of the world,
and those epithets which give us glimpses of its concreteness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
and contingency are the best guarantors of that. The regular
balancing of abstract and concrete modifiers, which we meet
regularly in Shakespeare, mirrors, indeed, the situation all of
us face in daily living, where general principles are clear in
theory but are conditioned in their application to the concrete
world. The man of eloquence must be a lover of “the world’s
body” to the extent of being able to give it a fond description.</p>

<p>With these conditions practically realized, we might again
have orators of the heroic mold. But the change would have
to include the public also, for, on a second thought suggested
by Whitman, to have great orators there must be great audiences
too.</p>

THE SPACIOUSNESS OF OLD RHETORIC</h2>

</div>

<p>Few species of composition seem so antiquated, so
little available for any practical purpose today, as the
oratory in which the generation of our grandparents
delighted. The type of discourse which they would ride miles
in wagons to hear, or would regard as the special treat of some
festive occasion, fills most people today with an acute sense
of discomfort. Somehow, it makes them embarrassed. They
become conscious of themselves, conscious of pretensions in
it, and they think it well consigned to the museum. But its
very ability to inspire antipathy, as distinguished from indifference,
suggests the presence of something interesting.</p>

<p>The student of rhetoric should accordingly sense here the
chance for a discovery, and as he begins to listen for its revealing
quality, the first thing he becomes aware of is a “spaciousness.”
This is, of course, a broad impression, which requires
its own analysis. As we listen more carefully, then, it
seems that between the speech itself and the things it is meant
to signify, something stands—perhaps it is only an empty space—but
something is there to prevent immediate realizations and
references. For an experience of the sensation, let us for a moment
go back to 1850 and attune our ears to an address by
Representative Andrew Ewing, on the subject of the sale of
the public lands.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We have afforded a refuge to the down-trodden nations of the
Old World, and organized system of internal improvement and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
public education, which have no parallel in the history of mankind.
Why should we not continue and enlarge the system which has so
much contributed to these results? If our Pacific Coast should be
lined with its hundred cities, extending from the northern boundary
of Oregon down to San Diego; if the vast interior hills and valleys
could be filled with lowing herds and fruitful fields of a thriving
and industrious people; and if the busy hum of ten thousand workshops
could be daily heard over the placid waters of the Pacific,
would our government be poorer or our country less able to meet
her obligations than at present?<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Despite the allusions to geographical localities, does not the
speaker seem to be speaking <i>in vacuo</i>? His words do not impinge
upon a circumambient reality; his concepts seem not to
have definite correspondences, but to be general, and as it
were, mobile. “Spread-eagle” and “high-flown” are two modifiers
with which people have sought to catch the quality of
such speech.</p>

<p>In this work we are interested both in causes and the moral
quality of causes, and when an orator appears to speak of subjects
without an immediate apperception of them, we become
curious about the kind of world he is living in. Was this type
of orator sick, as some have inferred? Was he suffering from
some kind of auto-intoxication which produces insulation
from reality? Charles Egbert Craddock in her novel <i>Where
the Battle Was Fought</i> has left a satirical picture of the type.
Its personification is General Vayne, who holds everything up
to a “moral magnifying glass.” “Through this unique lens life
loomed up as a rather large affair. In the rickety courthouse in
the village of Chattalla, five miles out there to the south, General
Vayne beheld a temple of justice. He translated an office-holder
as the sworn servant of the people. The State was this
great commonwealth, and its seal a proud escutcheon. A fall
in cotton struck him as a blow to the commerce of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
From an adverse political fortune he augured the swift ruin of
the country.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> There is the possibility that this type was sick
with a kind of vanity and egocentricity, and that has frequently
been offered as a diagnosis. But on the other hand, there is
the possibility that such men were larger than we, with our
petty and contentious style, and because larger more exposed
in those limitations which they had. The heroes in tragedies
also talk bigger than life. Perhaps the source of our discomfort
is that this kind of speech comes to us as an admonition that
there were giants in the earth before us, mighty men, men of
renown. But before we are ready for any conclusion, we must
isolate the cause of our intimation.</p>

<p>As we scan the old oratory for the chief offender against
modern sensibility, we are certain to rank in high position, if
not first, <i>the uncontested term</i>. By this we mean the term
which seems to invite a contest, but which apparently is not
so regarded in its own context. Most of these are terms which
scandalize the modern reader with their generality, so that he
wonders how the speaker ever took the risk of using them.
No experienced speaker interlards his discourse with terms
which are themselves controversial. He may build his case on
one or two such terms, after giving them <i>ad hoc</i> definitions,
but to multiply them is to create a force of resistance which
almost no speech can overcome. Yet in this period we have
speeches which seem made up almost from beginning to end
of phrases loose in scope and but weakly defensible. Yet the
old orator who employed these terms of sweeping generality
knew something of his audience’s state of mind and was confident
of his effect. And the public generally responded by
putting him in the genus “great man.” This brings us to the
rhetorical situation, which must be described in some detail.</p>

<p>We have said that this orator of the old-fashioned mold, who
is using the uncontested term, passes on his collection of generalities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
in full expectation that they will be received as legal
tender. He is taking a very advanced position, which could be
undermined easily, were the will to do so present. But the will
was not present, and this is the most significant fact in our
explanation. The orator had, in any typical audience, not only
a previously indoctrinated group, but a group of quite similar
indoctrination. Of course, we are using such phrases for purposes
of comparison with today. It is now a truism that the
homogeneity of belief which obtained three generations ago
has largely disappeared. Such belief was, in a manner of conceiving
it, the old orator’s capital. And it was, if we may trust
the figure further, an initial asset which made further operations
possible.</p>

<p>If we knew how this capital is accumulated, we would possess
one of the secrets of civilization. All we know is that whatever
spells the essential unity of a people in belief and attachment
contains the answer. The best we can do at this stage is
look into the mechanism of relationship between this level of
generality and the effectiveness of a speech.</p>

<p>We must keep in mind that “general” is itself a relative
modifier, and that the degree of generality with which one
may express one’s thoughts is very wide. One may refer, for
example, to a certain event as a <i>murder</i>, a <i>crime</i>, an <i>act</i>, or an
<i>occurrence</i>. We assume that none of these terms is inherently
falsifying, because none of them is in any prior sense required.
Levels of generality do not contradict one another; they supplement
one another by bringing out different foci of interest.
Every level of generality has its uses: the Bible can tell the
story of creation in a few hundred words, and it is doubtless
well that it should be told there in that way. Let us therefore
take a guarded position here and claim only that one’s level
of generality tells something of one’s approach to a subject.
We shall find certain refinements of application possible as
we go on.</p>

<p>With this as a starting point, we should be prepared for a
more intensive look at the diction of the old school. For purposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of this analysis I shall choose something that is historically
obscure. Great occasions sometimes deflect our judgment
by their special circumstances. The passage below is from a
speech made by the Honorable Charles J. Faulkner at an agricultural
fair in Virginia in 1858. Both speaker and event have
passed into relative oblivion, and we can therefore view this
as a fairly stock specimen of the oratory in vogue a hundred
years ago to grace local celebrations. Let us attend to it carefully
for its references.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If we look to the past or to the present we shall find that the
permanent power of any nation has always been in proportion to its
cultivation of the soil—those republics which during the earlier
and middle ages, were indebted for their growth mainly to commerce,
did for a moment, indeed, cast a dazzling splendor across
the pathway of time; but they soon passed from among the powers
of the earth, leaving behind them not a memorial of their proud
and ephemeral destiny whilst other nations, which looked to the
products of the soil for the elements of their strength, found in each
successive year the unfailing sources of national aggrandizement
and power. Of all the nations of antiquity, the Romans were most
persistently devoted to agriculture, and many of the maxims taught
by their experience, and transmitted to us by their distinguished
writers, are not unworthy, even at this time, of the notice of the
intelligent farmers of this valley. It was in their schools of country
life—a <i>vita rustica</i>—as their own great orator informs us, that they
imbibed those noble sentiments which rendered the Roman name
more illustrious than all their famous victories, and there, that
they acquired those habits of labor, frugality, justice and that high
standard of moral virtue which made them the easy masters of
their race.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A modern mind trained in the habit of analysis will be horrified
by the number of large and unexamined phrases passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
by in even this brief excerpt. “Permanent power of any nation”;
“earlier and middle ages”; “cast a dazzling splendor
across the pathway of time”; “proud and ephemeral destiny”;
“noble sentiments which rendered the Roman name more
illustrious”; and “high standards of moral virtue” are but a
selection. Comparatively speaking, the tone of this oration is
fairly subdued, but it is in the grand style, and these phrases
are the medium. With this passage before us for reference,
I wish to discuss one matter of effect, and one of cause or enabling
condition.</p>

<p>It will be quickly perceived that the phrases in question
have resonances, both historical and literary, and that this
resonance is what we have been calling spaciousness. Instead
of the single note (prized for purposes of analysis) they are
widths of sound and meaning; they tend to echo over broad
areas and to call up generalized associations. This resonance
is the interstice between what is said and the thing signified.
In this way then the generality of the phrase may be definitely
linked with an effect.</p>

<p>But the second question is our principal interest: how was
the orator able to use them with full public consent when he
cannot do so today?</p>

<p>I am going to suggest that the orator then enjoyed a privilege
which can be compared to the lawyer’s “right of assumption.”
This is the right to assume that precedents are valid, that forms
will persist, and that in general one may build today on what
was created yesterday. What mankind has sanctified with
usage has a presumption in its favor. Such presumption, it was
felt, instead of being an obstacle to progress, furnishes the
ground for progress. More simply, yesterday’s achievements
are also contributions to progress. It is he who insists upon beginning
every day <i>de novo</i> who denies the reality of progress.
Accordingly, consider the American orator in the intellectual
climate of this time. He was comfortably circumstanced with
reference to things he could “know” and presume everyone
else to know in the same way. Freedom and morality were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
constants; the Constitution was the codification of all that was
politically feasible; Christianity of all that was morally authorized.
Rome stood as an exemplum of what may happen to
nations; the American and French Revolutions had taught
rulers their necessary limitations. Civilization has thought
over its thousands of years of history and has made some generalizations
which are the premises of other arguments but
which are not issues themselves. When one asserts that the
Romans had a “high standard of moral virtue which made
them the easy masters of their race,” one is affirming a doctrine
of causality in a sweeping way. If one had to stop and “prove”
that moral virtue makes one master, one obviously would have
to start farther down the ladder of assumption. But these
things were not in the area of argument because progress was
positive and that meant that some things have to be assimilated
as truths. Men were not condemned to repeat history, because
they remembered its lessons. To the extent that the
mind had made its summations, it was free to go forward, and
forward meant in the direction of more inclusive conceptions.
The orator who pauses along the way to argue a point which
no one challenges only demeans the occasion. Therefore the
orator of the period we have defined did not feel that he had
to argue the significance of everything to which he attached
significance. Some things were fixed by universal enlightened
consensus; and they could be used as steps for getting at matters
which were less settled and hence were proper subjects
for deliberation. Deliberation is good only because it decreases
the number of things it is necessary to deliberate about.</p>

<p>Consequently when we wonder how he could use such
expressions without trace of compunction, we forget that the
expressions did not need apology. The speaker of the present
who used like terms would, on the contrary, meet a contest at
every step of the way. His audience would not swallow such
clusters of related meanings. But at that time a number of
unities, including the unity of past and present, the unity of
moral sets and of causal sets, furnished the ground for discourse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
in “uncontested terms.” Only such substratum of agreement
makes possible the panoramic treatment.</p>

<p>We can infer important conclusions about a civilization
when we know that its debates and controversies occur at outpost
positions rather than within the citadel itself. If these
occur at a very elementary level, we suspect that the culture
has not defined itself, or that it is decayed and threatened
with dissolution. Where the chief subject of debate is the relative
validity of Homoiousianism and Homoousianism, or the
conventions of courtly love, we feel confident that a great deal
has been cached away in the form of settled conclusions, and
that such shaking as proceeds from controversies of this kind,
although they may agitate the superstructure, will hardly be
felt as far down as the foundations. I would say the same is
suggested by the great American debate over whether the
Constitution was a “constitution” or a “compact,” despite its
unfortunate sequel.</p>

<p>At this stage of cultural development the commonplaces of
opinion and conduct form a sort of <i>textus receptus</i>, and the
emendations are confined to minor matters. Conversely, when
the disagreement is over extremely elementary matters, survival
itself may be at stake. It seems to me that modern debates
over the validity of the law of contradiction may be a
disagreement of this kind. The soundness of a culture may
well be measured by this ability to recognize what is extraneous.
One knows what to do with the extraneous, even if one
decides upon a policy of temporary accommodation. It is
when the line dividing us from the extraneous begins to fade
that we are assailed with destructive doubts. Disagreements
over the most fundamental subjects leave us puzzled as to
“where we are” if not as to “what we are.” The speaker whom
we have been characterizing felt sure of the demarcation.
That gave him his freedom, and was the source of his simplicity.</p>

<p>When we reflect further that the old oratory had a certain
judicial flavor about it, we are prompted to ask whether thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
as then conceived did not have a different status from
today’s thinking. One is led to make this query by the suggestion
that when the most fundamental propositions of a culture
are under attack, then it becomes a duty to “think for one’s
self.” Not that it is a bad thing to think; yet when the whole
emphasis is upon “thinking for one’s self,” it is hard to avoid
a feeling that certain postulates have broken down, and the
most courage we can muster is to ask people, not to “think
in a certain direction,” but to “think for themselves.” Where
the primary directive of thinking is known, the object of thinking
will not be mere cerebral motion (as some exponents of
the policy of thinking for one’s self leave us to infer), but
rather the object of such thinking, or knowledge. This is
a very rudimentary proposition, but it deserves attention
because the modern tendency has reversed a previous order.
From the position that only propositions are interesting because
they alone make judgments, we are passing to a position
in which only evidence is interesting because it alone is uncontaminated
by propositions. In brief, interest has shifted
from inference to reportage, and this has had a demonstrable
effect upon the tone of oratory. The large resonant phrase is
itself a kind of condensed proposition; as propositions begin
to sink with the general sagging of the substructure, the
phrases must do the same. Obviously we are pointing here to
a profound cultural change, and the same shifts can be seen in
literature; the poet or novelist may feel that the content of his
consciousness is more valid (and this will be true even of those
who have not formulated the belief) than the formal arrangement
which would be produced by selection, abstraction, and
arrangement. Or viewed in another respect, experiential order
has taken precedence over logical order.</p>

<p>The object of an oration made on the conditions obtained
a hundred years ago was not so much to “make people think”
as to remind them of what they already thought (and again
we are speaking comparatively). The oratorical rostrum, like
the church, was less of a place for fresh instruction than for
steady inculcation. And the orator, like the minister, was one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
who spoke from an eminent degree of conviction. Paradoxically,
the speaker of this vanished period had more freedom
to maneuver than has his emancipated successor. Man is free
in proportion as his surroundings have a determinate nature,
and he can plan his course with perfect reliance upon that
determinateness. It is an admitted axiom that we have rules in
one place so that we can have liberty in another; we put certain
things in charge of habit so as to be free in areas where
we prize freedom. Manifestly one is not “free” when one has
to battle for one’s position at every moment of time. This
interrelationship of freedom and organization is one of the
permanent conditions of existence, so that it has been said
even that perfect freedom is perfect compliance (“one commands
nature by obeying her”).</p>

<p>In the province we are considering, man is free to the
extent that he knows that nature is, what God expects, what
he himself is capable of. Freedom moves on a set of presuppositions
just as a machine moves on a set of ball bearings
which themselves preserve definite locus. It is when these
presuppositions are tampered with that men begin to grow
concerned about their freedom. One can well imagine that the
tremendous self-consciousness about freedom today, which
we note in almost every utterance of public men, is evidence
that this crucial general belief is threatened. It is no mere
paradox to say that when they cry liberty, they mean belief—the
belief that sets one free from prior concerns. A corroborating
evidence is that fact that nearly all large pleas for liberty
heard today conclude with more or less direct appeals
for unity.</p>

<p>We may now return to our more direct concern with rhetoric.
Since according to this demonstration oratory speaks
from an eminence and has a freedom of purview, its syllogism
is the “rhetorical syllogism” mentioned by Demetrius—the
enthymeme.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> It may not hurt to state that this is the syllogism
with one of the three propositions missing. Such a syllogism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
can be used only when the audience is willing to supply the
missing proposition. The missing proposition will be “in their
hearts,” as it were; it will be their agreement upon some fundamental
aspect of the issue being discussed. If it is there, the
orator does not have to supply it; if it is not there, he may not
be able to get it in any way—at least not as orator. Therefore
the use of the rhetorical syllogism is good concrete evidence
that the old orator relied upon the existence of uncontested
terms or fixations of belief in the minds of his hearers. The
orator was logical, but he could dispense with being a pure
logician because that third proposition had been established
for him.</p>

<p>These two related considerations, the accepted term and
the conception of oratory as a body of judicious conclusions
upon common evidence, go far toward explaining the quality
of spaciousness. Indeed, to say that oratory has “spaciousness”
is to risk redundancy once the nature of oratory is understood.
Oratory is “spacious” in the same way that liberal education
is liberal; and a correlation can be shown between the decline
of liberal education (the education of a freeman) and the
decline of oratory. It was one of Cicero’s observations that the
orator performs at “the focal point at which all human activity
is ultimately reviewed”; and Cicero is, for connected reasons,
a chief source of our theory of liberal education.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Thus far we have rested our explanation on the utility of
the generalized style, but this is probably much too narrow an
account. There is also an aesthetic of the generalization,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
which we must now proceed to explore. Let us pause here
momentarily to re-define our impression upon hearing the old
orator. The feature which we have been describing as spaciousness
may be translated, with perhaps a slight shift of
viewpoint, as opacity. The passages we have inspected, to
recur to our examples, are opaque in that we cannot see
through them with any sharpness. And it was no doubt the
intention of the orator that we should not see through them
in this way. The “moral magnifying glass” of Craddock’s General
Vayne made objects larger, but it did not make them
clearer. It rather had the effect of blurring lines and obscuring
details.</p>

<p>We are now in position to suggest that another factor in the
choice of the generalized phrase was aesthetic distance. There
is an aesthetic, as well as a moral, limit to how close one may
approach an object; and the forensic artists of the epoch we
describe seem to have been guided by this principle of artistic
decorum. Aesthetic distance is, of course, an essential of
aesthetic treatment. If one sees an object from too close, one
sees only its irregularities and protuberances. To see an object
rightly or to see it as a whole, one has to have a proportioned
distance from it. Then the parts fall into a meaningful
pattern, the dominant effect emerges, and one sees it “as it
really is.” A prurient interest in closeness and a great remoteness
will both spoil the view. To recall a famous example in
literature, neither Lilliputian nor Brobdingnagian is man as
we think we know him.</p>

<p>Thus it can be a sign not only of philosophical ignorance but
also of artistic bad taste to treat an object familiarly or from a
near proximity. At the risk of appearing fanciful we shall say
that objects have not only their natures but their rights, which
the orator is bound to respect, since he is in large measure the
ethical teacher of society. By maintaining this distance with
regard to objects, art manages to “idealize” them in a very
special sense. One does not mean by this that it necessarily
elevates them or transfigures them, but it certainly does keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
out a kind of officious detail which would only lower the general
effect. What the artistic procedure tends to do, then, is to
give us a “generic” picture, and much the same can be said
about oratory. The true orator has little concern with singularity—or,
to recall again a famous instance, with the wart on
Cromwell’s face—because the singular is the impertinent. Only
the generic belongs, and by obvious connection the language
of the generic is a general language. In the old style, presentation
kept distances which had, as one of their purposes, the obscuring
of details. It would then have appeared the extreme
of bad taste to particularize in the manner which has since,
especially in certain areas of journalism, become a literary
vogue. It would have been beyond the pale to refer, in anything
intended for the public view, to a certain cabinet minister’s
false teeth or a certain congressman’s shiny dome. Aesthetically,
this was not the angle of vision from which one
takes in the man, and there is even the question of epistemological
truthfulness. Portrait painters know that still, and journalists
knew it a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>It will be best to illustrate the effect of aesthetic distance.
I have chosen a passage from the address delivered by John
C. Breckinridge, Vice-President of the United States, on the
occasion of the removal of the Senate from the Old to the New
Chamber, January 4, 1859. The moment was regarded as
solemn, and the speaker expressed himself as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And now the strifes and uncertainties of the past are finished.
We see around us on every side the proofs of stability and improvement.
This Capitol is worthy of the Republic. Noble public
buildings meet the view on every hand. Treasures of science and
the arts begin to accumulate. As this flourishing city enlarges, it
testifies to the wisdom and forecast that dictated the plan of it.
Future generations will not be disturbed with questions concerning
the center of population or of territory, since the steamboat, the
railroad and the telegraph have made communication almost instantaneous.
The spot is sacred by a thousand memories, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
so many pledges that the city of Washington, founded by him and
bearing his revered name, with its beautiful site, bounded by picturesque
eminences, and the broad Potomac, and lying within
view of his home and his tomb, shall remain forever the political
capital of the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>At the close of the address, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>And now, Senators, we leave this memorable chamber, bearing
with us, unimpaired, the Constitution received from our forefathers.
Let us cherish it with grateful acknowledgments of the
Divine Power who controls the destinies of empires and whose
goodness we adore. The structures reared by man yield to the
corroding tooth of time. These marble walls must molder into ruin;
but the principles of constitutional liberty, guarded by wisdom
and virtue, unlike material elements, do not decay. Let us devoutly
trust that another Senate in another age shall bear to a new and
larger Chamber, the Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that
the last generations of posterity shall witness the deliberations of
the Representatives of American States still united, prosperous,
and free.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We shall hardly help noting the prominence of “opaque”
phrases. “Proofs of stability and improvement”; “noble public
buildings”; “treasures of science and the arts”; “this flourishing
city”; “a thousand memories”; “this beautiful site”; and
“structures reared by man” seem outstanding examples. These
all express objects which can be seen only at a distance of time
or space. In three instances, it is true, the speaker mentions
things of which his hearers might have been immediately and
physically conscious, but they receive an appropriately generalized
reference. The passage admits not a single intrusive
detail, nor is anything there supposed to have a superior validity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
or probativeness because it is present visibly or tangibly.
The speech is addressed to the mind, and correspondingly to
the memory.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The fact that the inclusiveness was temporal as
well as spatial has perhaps special significance for us. This
“continuity of the past with the present” gave a dimension
which our world seems largely to have lost; and this dimension
made possible a different pattern of selection. It is not
experiential data which creates a sense of the oneness of experience.
It is rather an act of mind; and the practice of periodically
bringing the past into a meditative relationship with
the present betokens an attitude toward history. In the chapter
on Lincoln we have shown that an even greater degree of
remoteness is discernible in the First and Second Inaugural
Addresses, delivered at a time when war was an ugly present
reality. And furthermore, at Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke in
terms so “generic” that it is almost impossible to show that the
speech is not a eulogy of the men in gray as well as the men in
blue, inasmuch as both made up “those who struggled here.”
Lincoln’s faculty of transcending an occasion is in fact only
this ability to view it from the right distance, or to be wisely
generic about it.</p>

<p>We are talking here about things capable of extremes, and
there is a degree of abstraction which results in imperception;
but barring those cases which everyone recognizes as beyond
bounds, we should reconsider the idea that such generalization
is a sign of impotence. The distinction does not lie between
those who are near life and those who are remote from
it, but between pertinence and impertinence. The intrusive
detail so prized by modern realists does not belong in a picture
which is a picture of something. One of the senses of “seeing”
is metaphorical, and if one gets too close to the object, one
can no longer in this sense “see.” It is the <i>theoria</i> of the mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
as well as the work of the senses which creates the final picture.</p>

<p>One can show this through an instructive contrast with
modern journalism, particularly that of the <i>Time</i> magazine
variety. A considerable part of its material, and nearly all of
its captions, are made up of what we have defined as “impertinences.”
What our forensic artist of a century ago would have
regarded as lacking significance is in these media presented
as the pertinent because it is very near the physical manifestation
of the event. And the reversal has been complete, because
what for this artist would have been pertinent is there
treated as impertinent since it involves matter which the
average man does not care to reflect upon, especially under
the conditions of newspaper reading. Thus even the epistemology
which made the old oratory possible is being relegated.</p>

<p>We must take notice in this connection that the lavish use
of detail is sometimes defended on the ground that it is illustration.
The argument runs that illustration is a visual aid to
education, and therefore an increased use of illustration contributes
to that informing of the public which journals acknowledge
as their duty. But a little reflection about the nature
of illustration will show where this idea is treacherous.
Illustration, as already indicated, implies that something is
being illustrated, so that in the true illustration we will have a
conjunction of mind and pictorial manifestation. But now,
with brilliant technological means, the tendency is for manifestation
to outrun the idea, so that the illustrations are vivid
rather than meaningful or communicative. Thus, whereas today
the illustration is looking for an idea to express, formerly
the idea was the original; and it was looking, often rather fastidiously,
for some palpable means of representation. The
idea condescended, one might say, from an empyrean, to suffer
illustrative embodiment.</p>

<p>To make this difference more real, let us study an example
of the older method of illustration. The passage below examined
is from an address by Rufus Choate on “The Position and
Function of the American Bar as an Element of Conservatism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
in the State,” delivered before the Law School in Cambridge,
July 3, 1845.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But with us the age of this mode and degree of reform is over; its
work is done. The passage of the sea; the occupation and culture
of a new world, the conquest of independence—these were our
eras, these our agency of reform. In our jurisprudence of liberty,
which guards our person from violence and our goods from plunder,
and which forbids the whole power of the state itself to take
the ewe lamb, or to trample on a blade of grass of the humblest
citizen without adequate remuneration: which makes every dwelling
large enough to shelter a human life its owner’s castle which
winds and rain may enter, but which the government cannot,—in
our written constitution, whereby the people, exercising an act of
sublime self-restraint, have intended to put it out of their power
forever to be passionate, tumultuous, unwise, unjust, whereby they
have intended, by means of a system of representation, by means
of the distribution of government into departments independent,
coordinate for checks and balances; by a double chamber of legislation,
by the establishment of a fundamental and permanent
organic law; by the organization of a judiciary whose function,
whose loftiest function it is to test the legislation of the day by the
standard of all time,—constitutions, whereby all these means they
have intended to secure a government of laws, not of men, of reason,
not of will; of justice, not of fraud,—in that grand dogma of
equality,—equality of right, of burthens, of duty, of privileges, and
of chances, which is the very mystery of our social being—to the
Jews a stumbling block; to the Greeks foolishness,—our strength,
our glory,—in that liberty which we value not solely because it is
a natural right of man; not solely because it is a principle of individual
energy and a guaranty of national renown; not at all because
it attracts a procession and lights a bonfire, but because, when
blended with order, attended by law, tempered by virtue, graced by
culture, it is a great practical good; because in her right hand are
riches and honor and peace, because she has come down from her
golden and purple cloud to walk in brightness by the weary ploughman’s
side, and whisper in his ear as he casts his seed with tears,
that the harvest which frost and mildew and cankerworm shall
spare, the government shall spare also; in our distribution into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
separate and kindred states, not wholly independent, not quite
identical, in “the wide arch of ranged empire” above—these are
they in which the fruits of our age and our agency of reform are
embodied; and these are they by which, if we are wise,—if we understand
the things that belong to our peace—they may be perpetuated.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We note in passing the now familiar panorama. One must view
matters from a height to speak without pause of such things
as “occupation and culture of a new world,” “conquest of independence,”
and “fundamental and permanent organic law.”
Then we note that when the orator feels that he must illustrate,
the illustration is not through the impertinent concrete
case, but through the poeticized figment. At the close of the
passage, where the personification of liberty is encountered,
we see in clearest form the conventionalized image which is
the traditional illustration. Liberty, sitting up in her golden
and purple cloud, descends “to walk in brightness by the
weary ploughman’s side.” In this flatulent utterance there is
something so typical of method (as well as indicative of the
philosophy of the method) that one can scarcely avoid recalling
that this is how the gods of classical mythology came down
to hold discourse with mortals; it is how the god of the Christian
religion came into the world for the redemption of mankind;
it is how the <i>logos</i> is made incarnate. In other words,
this kind of manifestation from above is, in our Western tradition,
an archetypal process, which the orators of that tradition
are likely to follow implicitly. The idea is supernal; it
may be brought down for representation; but casual, fortuitous,
individual representations are an affront to it. Consequently
the representations are conventionalized images, and
work with general efficacy.</p>

<p>This thought carries us back to our original point, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
that standards of pertinence and impertinence have very deep
foundations, and that one may reveal one’s whole system of
philosophy by the stand one takes on what is pertinent. We
have observed that a powerful trend today is toward the
unique detail and the illustration of photographic realism, and
this tendency claims to be more knowledgeable about reality.
In the older tradition which we set out to examine, the abstracted
truth and the illustration which is essentially a construct
held a like favor. It was not said, because there was no
contrary style to make the saying necessary, but it was certainly
felt that these came as near the truth as one gets, if
one admits the existence of non-factual kinds of truth. The
two sides do not speak to one another very well across the
gulf, but it is certainly possible to find, and it would seem
to be incumbent upon scholars to find, a conception broad
enough to define the difference.</p>

<p>One further clue we have as to how the orator thought and
how he saw himself. There will be observed in most speeches
of this era a stylization of utterance. It is this stylization which
largely produces their declamatory quality. At the same time,
as we begin to infer causes, we discover the source of its propriety;
the orator felt that he was speaking for corporate
humanity. He had a sense of stewardship which would today
appear one of the presumptions earlier referred to. The individual
orator was not, except perhaps in certain postures,
offering an individual testimonial. He was the mouthpiece for
a collective brand of wisdom which was not to be delivered
in individual accents. We may suppose that the people did not
resent the stylizations of the orator any more than now they
resent the stylizations of the Bible. “That is the way God talks.”
The deity should be above mere novelties of expression, transparent
devices of rhetoric, or importunate appeals for attention.
It is enough for him to be earnest and truthful; we will
rise to whatever patterns of expression it has pleased him to
use. Stylization indicates an attitude which will not concede
too much, or certainly will not concede weakly or complacently.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
As in point of historical sequence the language of political
discourse succeeded that of the sermon, some of the latter’s
dignity and self-confidence persisted in the way of formalization.
Thus when the orator made gestures toward the occasion,
they were likely to be ceremonious rather than personal
or spontaneous, the oration itself being an occasion of “style.”
The modern listener is very quick to detect a pattern of locution,
but he is prone to ascribe it to situations of weakness
rather than of strength.</p>

<p>Of course oratory of the broadly ruminative kind is acceptable
only when we accredit someone with the ability to review
our conduct, our destiny, and the causes of things in general.
If we reach a condition in which no man is believed to have
this power, we will accordingly be impatient with that kind of
discourse. It should not be overlooked that although the
masses in any society are comparatively ill-trained and ignorant,
they are very quick to sense attitudes, through their
native capacity as human beings. When attitudes change at
the top of society, they are able to see that change long before
they are able to describe it in any language of their own, and
in fact they can see it without ever doing that. The masses thus
follow intellectual styles, and more quickly than is often supposed,
so that, in this particular case, when a general skepticism
of predication sets in among the leaders of thought, the
lower ranks are soon infected with the same thing (though
one must make allowance here for certain barriers to cultural
transmission constituted by geography and language). This
principle will explain why there is no more appetite for the
broadly reflective discourse among the general public of today
than among the <i>élite</i>. The stewardship of man has been hurt
rather than helped by the attacks upon natural right, and at
present nobody knows who the custodians (in the old sense
of “watchers”) are. Consequently it is not easy for a man to
assume the ground requisite for such a discourse. Speeches
today either are made for entertainment, or they are political
speeches for political ends. And the chief characteristic of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
speech for political ends is that it is made for immediate effect,
with the smallest regard for what is politically true. Whereas
formerly its burden was what the people believed or had
experienced, the burden now tends to be what they wish to
hear. The increased reliance upon slogans and catchwords,
and the increased use of the argument from contraries (<i>e.g.</i>,
“the thing my opponent is doing will be welcomed by the
Russians”) are prominent evidences of the trend.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the old style may be called, in comparison with what
has succeeded, a polite style. Its very diffuseness conceals a
respect for the powers and limitations of the audience. Bishop
Whatley has observed that highly concentrated expression
may be ill suited to persuasion because the majority of the
people are not capable of assimilating concentrated thought.
The principle can be shown through an analogy with nutrition.
It is known that diet must contain a certain amount of roughage.
This roughage is not food in the sense of nutriment; its
function is to dilute or distend the real food in such a way that
it can be most readily assimilated. A concentrate of food is,
therefore, not enough, for there has to be a certain amount of
inert matter to furnish bulk. Something of a very similar
nature operates in discourse. When a piece of oratory intended
for a public occasion impresses us as distended, which is to
say, filled up with repetition, periphrasis, long grammatical
forms, and other impediments to directness, we should recall
that the diffuseness all this produces may have a purpose. The
orator may have made a close calculation of the receptive
powers of his audience and have ordered his style to meet that,
while continuing to “sound good” at every point. This represents
a form of consideration for the audience. There exists
quite commonly today, at the opposite pole, a syncopated
style. This style, with its suppression of beats and its consequent
effect of hurrying over things, does not show that type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of consideration. It does not give the listener the roughage of
verbiage to chew on while meditating the progress of the
thought. Here again “spaciousness” has a quite rational function
in enforcing a measure, so that the mind and the sentiments
too can keep up with the orator in his course.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is as far as we can go in explaining the one age
to another. We are now in position to realize that the archaic
formalism of the old orator was a structure imparted to his
speech by a logic, an aesthetic, and an epistemology. As a
logician he believed in the deduced term, or the term whose
empirical support is not at the moment visible. As an aesthetician
he believed in distance, and that not merely to soften outline
but also to evoke the true picture, which could be obscured
by an injudicious and prying nearness. As an epistemologist
he believed, in addition to the foregoing, that true
knowledge somehow had its source in the mind of minds, for
which we are on occasion permitted to speak a part. All this
gave him a peculiar sense of stature. He always talked like a
big man. Our resentment comes from a feeling that with all his
air of confidence he could not have known half as much as we
know. But everything depends on what we mean by knowing;
and the age or the man who has the true conception of that will
have, as the terms of the case make apparent, the key to every
other question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_VIII">Chapter VIII<br />
THE RHETORIC OF SOCIAL SCIENCE</h2>

</div>

<p>One of the serious problems of our age is the question
of how scientific information, which is largely the
product of special tools of investigation, shall be communicated
to the non-specialist world. A few sciences operate
in fields of theory so abstract that they can create their own
symbology, and most of what they transmit to the public will
be in the form of highly generalized translation. But there are
other sciences whose very success depends upon some public
understanding of what they are trying to solve, and these are
faced with peculiar problems of communication. None are in
so difficult a position as social science. The social sciences have
been, since their institution, jealous of their status as science,
and that is perhaps understandable. But their data is the
everyday life of man in society, and naturally if there is an area
of scientific discovery upon which the general public should
be posted, it is just this one of the laws of social phenomena.
Caught between this desire to remain scientific and the necessity
of public expression, most social scientists are in a dilemma.
They have not devised (and possibly they cannot devise)
their own symbology to rival that of the mathematician and
physicist. On the other hand, they have not set themselves to
learn the principles of sound rhetorical exposition. The result
is that the publications of social scientists contain a large
amount of conspicuously poor writing, which is now under
growing attack.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Some of these attacks have been perceptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
as well as witty; but I feel that no one has yet made the point
which most needs making, which is that the social scientists
will never write much better until they make terms with some
of the traditional rules of rhetoric.</p>

<p>I propose in the study which follows to ignore the isolated
small faults and instead to analyze the sources of pervasive
vices. I shall put the inquiry in the form of a series of questions,
which lead to cardinal principles of conception and of choice.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><i>Does the writing of social scientists suffer from a primary
equivocation?</i> The charge against social science writing which
would be most widely granted is that it fails to convince us
that it deals clearly with realities. This impression may lead to
the question of whether the social scientist knows what he is
talking about. Now this is a serious, not a frivolous, question,
involving matters of logic and epistemology; it is a question,
furthermore, that one finds the social scientists constantly
putting to themselves and answering in a variety of ways. Any
field of study is liable to a similar interrogation; in this instance
it merely asks whether those who interpret social behavior
in scientific terms are aware of the kind of data they
are handling. Are they dealing with facts, or concepts, or
evaluations, or all three? The answer given to this question
will have a definite bearing upon their problem of expression,
and let us see how this can happen in a concrete instance.</p>

<p>We have had much to say in preceding chapters about the
distinction between positive and dialectical terms; and nowhere
has the ignoring of this distinction had worse results
than in the literature of social science. We have seen, to review
briefly, that the positive term designates something existing
simply in the objective world: the chair, the tree, the farm.
Arguments over positive terms are not arguments in the true
sense, since the point at issue is capable of immediate and public
settlement, just as one might settle an “argument” over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
width of a room by bringing in a publicly-agreed-upon yardstick.
Consequently a rhetoric of positive terms is a rhetoric of
simple description, which requires only powers of accurate
observation and reporting.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with dialectical terms. These are terms standing
for concepts, which are defined by their negatives or their
privations. “Justice” is a dialectical term which is defined by
“injustice”; “social improvement” is made meaningful by the
use of “privation of social improvement.” To say that a family
has an income of $800.00 a year is positive; to say that the
same family is underprivileged is dialectical. It can be underprivileged
only with reference to families which have more
privileges. So it goes with the whole range of terms which
reflect judgments of value; “unjust,” “poor,” “underpaid,” “undesirable”
are all terms which depend on something more than
the external world for their significance.</p>

<p>Now here is where the social scientist crosses a divide that
he seldom acknowledges and often seems unaware of. One
cannot use the dialectical term in the same manner as one uses
the positive term because the dialectical term always leaves
one committed to something. It is a truth easily seen that all
dialectical terms make presumptions from the plain fact that
they are “positional” terms. A writer no sooner employs one
than he is engaged in an argument. To say that the universe
is purposeless is to join in argument with all who say it is purposeful.
To say that a certain social condition is inequitable
is to ally oneself with the reformers and against the standpatters.
In all such cases the presumption has to do with the
scope of the term and with its relationship to its opposite, and
these can be worked out only through the dialectical method
we have analyzed in other chapters. When the reader of social
science comes to such terms, he is baffled because he has not
been warned of the presumptions on which they rest. Or, to
be more exact, he has not been prepared for presumptions at
all. He finds himself reading at a level where the facts have
been subsumed, and where the exposition is a process of adjusting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
categories. The writer has passed with indifference
from what is objectively true to what is morally or imaginatively
true. The reader’s uneasiness comes from a feeling that
the categories themselves are the things which should have
been examined. Just here, however, may lie the crux of the
difficulty.</p>

<p>It begins to look as though the social scientist working with
his regular habits is actually a dialectician without a dialectical
basis. His dilemma is that he can neither use his terms
with the simple directness of the natural scientist pointing to
physical factors, nor with the assurance of a philosopher who
has some source for their meaning in the system from which he
begins his deduction. Or, the social scientist is trying to characterize
the world positively in terms which can be made good
only dialectically. He can never make them good dialectically
as long as he is by theory entirely committed to empiricism.
This explains why to the ordinary beholder there seem to
be so many smuggled assumptions in the literature of social
science. It will explain, moreover, why so much of its expression
is characterized by diffuseness and by that verbosity
which is certain to afflict a dialectic without a metaphysic or
an ontology. This uncertainty of the social scientist about the
nature of his datum often leads him to treat empirical situations
as if they carried moral sanction, and then to turn around
and treat some point of contemporary mores—which is by
definition a “moral” question—as if it had only empirical aspects.
In direct consequence, when the social scientist should
be writing “positively,” like a crack newspaper reporter, one
finds him writing like Hegel, and, when the stage of his exposition
might warrant his writing more or less like Hegel, one
finds him employing dialectical terms as if they had positive
designations.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, his very reverence for facts may tend to make
him sound like Hegel or some other master of categorical
thinking. Anyone sampling the literature of social science cannot
fail to be impressed with the proportion of space given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
definition. Indeed, one of the most convincing claims of the
science is that our present-day knowledge of man is defective
because our definitions are simplistic. His behavior is much
more varied than the unscientific suppose; and therefore a
central objective of social study is definition, which will take
this variety into account and supplant our present “prejudiced”
definitions. With this in mind, the social scientist toils
in library or office to prepare the best definitions he can of
human nature, of society, and of psychosocial environment.</p>

<p>The danger for him in this laudable endeavor seems twofold.
First, one must remark that the language of definition is
inevitably the language of generality because only the generalizable
is definable. Singulars and individuals can be described
but not defined; <i>e.g.</i>, one can define man, but one can
only describe Abraham Lincoln. The greater, then, his solicitude
for the factual and the concrete, the more irresistibly is
he borne in the direction of abstract language, which alone
will encompass his collected facts. His dissertations on human
society begin with obeisance to facts, but the logic of his being
a scientist condemns him to abstraction. He is forced toward
the position of the proverbial revolutionary, who loves mankind
but has little charity for those particular specimens of
it with whom he must associate.</p>

<p>In the second place and more importantly, the definition of
non-empirical terms is itself a dialectical process. All such
definition takes the form of an argument which must prove
that the <i>definiendum</i> is one thing and not another thing. The
limits of the definition are thus the boundary between the
things and the not-thing. Someone might inquire at this stage
of our account whether the natural scientists, who must also
define, are not equally liable under this point of the argument.
The distinction is that definitions in natural science have a different
ontological basis. The properties about which they generalize
exist not in logical connection but in empirical conjunction,
as when “mammal,” “vertebrate,” and “quadruped”
are used to distinguish the genus <i>Felis</i>. The doctrine of “natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
kinds” thus remains an empirical classification, as does the
traditional classification of elements.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Consequently the genus
<i>Felis</i> has a reality in the form of compresent positive attributes
which “slum” cannot have. The establishment of the
genus is not a matter of negating or depriving other classes,
but of naming what is there. On the other hand one could
never arrive positivistically at a definition of “slum” because
its meaning is contingent upon judgment (and theoretically
our standard of living might move up to where Westchester,
Grosse Point, and Winnetka are regarded as slums). Thus
“slum” no more exists objectively than does “bad weather.”
There are collections of sticks and stones which the dialectician
may call “slums,” just as there are processions of the
elements which he may call “bad.” But these are positive things
only in a reductionist equation. Of course, the natural scientist
works always with reductionist equations; but the social scientist,
unless he is an extreme materialist, must work with the
full equation.</p>

<p>It is a grave imputation, but at the heart of the social scientist’s
unsatisfactory expression lies this equivocation. Remedy
here can come only with a clearer defining of province
and of responsibility.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><i>Is social science writing marred by “pedantic empiricism”?</i>
The natural desire of everyone to carry away something from
his reading encounters in this literature curious obstacles. Its
authors often seem unduly coy about their conclusions. After
the reader has been escorted on an extensive tour of facts and
definitions, he is likely to be told that little can be affirmed at
this stage of the inquiry. So it is that, however much we read,
we are made to feel that what we are reading is preliminary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
We come almost to look for a formula at the close of a social
science monograph which takes an excessively modest view
of its achievement while expressing the hope that someone
else may come along and do something with the data there
offered. Burgess and Cottrell’s <i>Predicting Success or Failure
in Marriage</i> provides an illustration. After presenting their
case, the authors say: “In this study, as in many others, the
most significant contribution is not to be found in any one finding
but in the degree to which the study opens up a new field
to further research.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Again, from an article appearing in
<i>Social Forces</i>: “The findings here mentioned are merely suggestive;
and they are offered in no sense as proof of our hypothesis
of folk-urban personality differences. The implementation
of the analysis given here would demand a field project
incorporating the type of methodological consciousness advocated
above. Thus we need to utilize standard projective devices,
but must be prepared to develop, in terms of situational
demands, additional analytic instruments.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> And Herman C.
Beyle in a chapter on the data and method of political science,
which constitute the underpinning of his whole study, can
only say that “the foregoing comments on the data and technology
of political science have been offered as most tentative
statements intended to provide a background for the testing
and application of the technique here proposed, that of attribute-cluster-bloc
identification and analysis.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> “Most tentative”
becomes a sort of leitmotiv. Everything sounds like a prolegomenon
to the real thing. Exclamations that social scientists
are taking in one another’s washing or are only trying to make
work for themselves are inspired by this kind of performance.</p>

<p>But, even after one has made allowance for the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
social science is not one of the exact sciences and that its disciples
work in a field where induction is far from complete,
their fear of commitment still seems obsessive. They could at
least have the courage of the facts which they have accumulated.
Virtually everyone who is seeking scientific enlightenment
on this level knows that conclusions are given in the light
of evidence available, and that hypothesis always extends
some distance beyond what is directly observable. Indeed,
everyone makes use of the method of scientific investigation, as
T. H. Huxley liked to assure his audiences, but not everyone
finds necessary such an armor of qualifications as is likely to
appear here: “On the basis of available evidence, it is not unreasonable
to suppose”; “It may not be improbable in view of
these findings”; “The present survey would seem to indicate.”
All these rhetorical contortions are forms of needless hedging.</p>

<p>It would be a different matter if such formulas of reservation
made the conclusion more precise. But in the majority of
cases it could be shown that the conclusion is obvious enough
in terms of the discussion itself, and they serve only to make
it sound timid. These scholars move to a tune of “induction
never ends,” and their scholarship often turns into a pedantic
empiricism. They seem to be waiting for the fact that will
bring with it the revelation. But that fact will never arrive;
experience does not tell us what we are experiencing, and at
some point they are going to have to give names to their findings—even
at the expense of becoming dialecticians.</p>

<p>If the needlessly hedged statement is one result of pedantic
empiricism, another occurs in what might be called “pedantic
analysis.” This is analysis for analysis’ sake, with no real
thought of relevance or application or, indeed, of a resynthesis
which might redeem the whole undertaking. Just as it is assumed
that an endless collection of data will necessarily yield
fruits, so it is assumed that a remorseless partitioning will illuminate.
But analysis can be carried so far that it seems to lose
all bearing upon points at issue. The writer shows himself a
sort of <i>virtuoso</i> at analysis, and one feels that his real interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
lies in demonstrating how thoroughly a method can be followed.
Let us look, for example, at a passage from an article
entitled “Courtship as a Social Institution in the United States,
1930-1945.” The author has said that activities of courtship
show different patterns and that sometimes the patterns need
to be harmonized:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To be compatible, patterns should be adapted to the following
components: (1) the <i>hominid component</i>, which is the biological
human being; (2) the <i>social component</i>, which includes the potentialities
for social relations as they are affected by “the number of
human beings in the situation, their distribution in space, their
ages, their sex, their native ability to interstimulate and interact,
the interference of environmental hindrances or helps, and the
presence and amount of certain types of social equipment”; (3)
the <i>environmental component</i>, or all the “natural” features of the
situation except the hominid, the social, the psychological and
artifactual components; it includes topography, physiography,
flora, fauna, weather, geology, soil, etc.; (4) the <i>psychological
component</i>, defined as the principles involving the acquisition and
performance of human customs not adequately explained on purely
biological principles; (5) the <i>artifactual component</i>, which consists
collectively of the material results and adjuncts of human
customary activities.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not always safe for the layman to generalize about the
value of specific sociological findings, but I am inclined to
think that this is verbiage, resulting from analysis pushed beyond
any useful purpose. There is a real if obscure relationship
between the vitality of what one is saying and the palatability
of one’s rhetoric. No rhythm, no <i>tournure</i> of phrase, no architecture
of the sentences could make this a good piece of writing,
for its content lies on the outer fringe of significance. It
is the nature of such pedantry to habit itself in a harsh and
crabbed style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>The primary step in literary composition is <i>invention</i>, or the
discovering of something to talk about. No writer is finally able
to make good the claim that his subject matter is one thing
and his style of expression another; the subject matter enters
into the expression inevitably and extensively, although sometimes
in ways too subtle for elucidation. What of the invention
of this passage? If we take the word in its etymological sense
of “finding,” are not these distinctions “findings” for findings’
sake? Analysis carried to such a humorless extreme reflects
discredit upon the very principle of division which was employed.</p>

<p>It may appear contradictory to call the social scientist a
“tendentious dialectician” and a “pedantic empiricist” at the
same time. But the contradiction is inherent in his situation
and merely expresses the equivocation found earlier. In all
likelihood the empiricism is an attempt to compensate for the
dialectic. If a writer feels guilty about his dialectic exercises
(his definitions), he may seek to counterweight them with
long empirical inquiries. The object of the empirical analysis
is primarily to give the work a scientific aspect and only secondarily
to prove something. In fact, this is almost the pattern
of inferior social science literature.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p><i>Does social science writing suffer from a melioristic bias?</i>
This question directs our attention to the matter of vocabulary.
There is danger in criticising any writer’s vocabulary through
application of simple principles, because demands vary widely.
For some purposes a small vocabulary of denotative terms
will be satisfactory. Other purposes cannot be adequately
met without a large and learned vocabulary which may, incidentally,
sound pretentious. Our question then becomes
whether the ends of social science are being well served by
the means employed. For example, social scientists are often
charged with addiction to polysyllabic vocabulary. Other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
men of learning show the same addiction, but there are special
reasons for weighing critically the polysyllabic diction of
social scientists.</p>

<p>Of course, when one faces the issue concretely, one discovers
that there is no single standard by which a word is classified
“big.” Some words are called “big” because they actually
have four or five syllables and hence are measurably so; other
words of one or two syllables are called “big” because, coming
out of technical or scientific vocabularies, they are unfamiliar
to the average man;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> others, actually no longer, are called “big”
because of the company they keep; that is to say, they are
words of learned or dignified association. Sometimes a word
seems big when it is simply too pretentious for the kind of
thing it is describing. Readers of H. L. Mencken will recall
that he obtained many of his best satirical effects by describing
what was essentially picayune or tawdry in a vocabulary of
grandiloquence.</p>

<p>A cursory inspection will show that social scientists are given
to words which are “big” in yet another respect: they have a
Latin origin. Even in analysis of simple phenomenon the reader
comes to expect a parade of terms which seem to go by on
stilts, as if it were important to keep from touching the ground.
Without raising questions of semantic theory, one inclines to
wonder about their relationship to their referents. In course
of time one may come to suspect that the words employed
are not dictated by the subject matter, but by some active
principle out of sociological theory. To see whether that suspicion
has a foundation, let us try a test on a specimen of this
language.</p>

<p>The passage which will be used is fairly representative of
the ordinary social science prose to be encountered in articles
and reports. The subject is expressed in the title “Social Nearness
among Welfare Institutions”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It was noticed in the preceding sections that the social welfare
organizational milieu presents an interdependence, a formal solidarity,
a coerced feeling of unity. However divergent the specific
objectives of each organization, theoretically they all have a common
purpose, the care of the so-called underprivileged. Whether
they execute what they profess or not is a different question and
one which does not fall within the confines of these pages.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There occur in this short excerpt about a dozen words of Latin
origin for which equivalents of Anglo-Saxon (or old English,
if the name is preferred) origin are available, and this without
giving up presumably operational terms like “organizational”
and “milieu.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> In place of “noticed,” why not “seen”? In place
of “divergent,” why not “unlike”? In place of “objective,”
why not “goal”? Instead of “execute what they profess,” why
not “do what they say”? Did these terms not suggest themselves
to the writer, or were they deliberately passed by?</p>

<p>It might be arbitrary to insist that any one of these substitutes
is better than the original, but the piling-up of such terms
causes language to take on a special aspect. There are, of
course, margins within which preference in terminology
means little, but a preference for Latinate terms as marked
as this must be, to employ one of their customary expressions,
“significant.”</p>

<p>That significance lies in the kind of attitude that social
scientists must have in order to practice social science. It
seems beyond dispute that all social science rests upon the
assumption that man and society are improvable. That is its
origin and its guiding impulse. The man who does not feel that
social behavior and social institutions can be bettered through
the application of scientific laws, or through some philosophy
finding its basic support in them, is surely out of place in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
sociology. There would really be nothing for him to do. He
could only sit on the sidelines and speculate dourly, like Nietzsche,
or ironically, like Santayana. The very profession which
the true social scientist adopts compels him to be a kind of a
priori optimist. This is why a large part of social science writing
displays a <i>melioristic bias</i>. It is under compulsion, often
unconsciously felt, I am sure, to picture things a little better
than they are. Such expression provides a kind of proof that
its theories are “working.”</p>

<p>An indubitable connection exists between the melioristic
bias and a Latinate vocabulary. Even a moderate sensitivity
to the overtones of language will tell one that diction of Latin
derivation tends to be euphemistic. For this there seem to be
both extrinsic and intrinsic causes. It is a commonplace of
historical knowledge that after the Norman Conquest the
Anglo-Saxons were forced into a servile role. They were sent
into the fields to do chores for the Norman overlords, and
Anglo-Saxon names have clung to the things with which they
worked. Thus to the Anglo-Saxon in the field the animal was
“cow”; to the Norman, when the same animal was served at
his table, it was “beef” (L. <i>bos</i>, <i>bovis</i>). So “calf” is translated
“veal”; “thegn” becomes “servant”; “folk” becomes “people,”
and so on. This distinction of common and elegant terms
persists in an area of our vocabulary today. Another circumstance
was that Latin for centuries constituted the language
of learning and of the professions throughout Europe, and
from the fourteenth century onward, there occurred a large
amount of “learned borrowing.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This reflects the fact that
those cultures which carried civility and <i>politesse</i> to highest
perfection drew from a Latin source. Finally, I would suggest
that the greater number of syllables in many Latinate terms is
a factor in the effect. Whatever the complete explanation, the
truth remains that to give a thing a Latinate name is to couple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
it with social prestige and with the world of ideas, whereas to
give it a name out of Anglo-Saxon is to forgo such dignifying
associations. Thus “combat” sounds more dignified than
“fight”; “labor” has resonances which “work” does not have;
“impecunious” seems to indicate a more hopeful condition
than “needy” or “penniless”; “involuntary separation” sounds
less painful than “getting fired.” The list could be extended
indefinitely. With exceptions too few to make a difference,
the Anglo-Saxon word is plain and workaday, whereas the
word of Latin derivation seems to invest whatever it describes
with a certain upward tendency. Of course, the Anglo-Saxon
word has its potencies, but they are not those of the other. It
seems to cling to the brute empirical fact, while its Latinate
counterpart seems at once to become ideological, with perhaps
a slight aura of hortation about it. Whenever one hears
the average man condemning a piece of discourse as “flowery,”
it is most likely that he is pointing, with the only term at his
command, to an excess of Latinate diction.</p>

<p>In the same connection, let us remember that the last few
years have seen much newspaper wit at the expense of the
language of government bureaucracy, which is even more
responsive to the melioristic bias. The bureaucrat lives in a
world where nothing is incorrigible; the solution to every contemporary
difficulty waits only for the devising of some appropriate
administrative machinery. Compared with him, the
social scientist is a realist, for social science at least begins by
admitting that many situations leave something to be desired.
The bureaucrat’s world is prim and proper and aseptic, and his
language reflects it (perhaps one could say that the discourse
of the bureaucrat is social science “politicalized”). At any
rate, here we might profitably look at a specimen of bureaucratic
parlance from Masterson and Phillips’ <i>Federal Prose</i>, a
recently published burlesque of official language. The authors
posed for themselves as one exercise the problem of how a
bureaucrat would express the ancient adage “Too many cooks
spoil the broth.” Their translation is a caricature, but, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
caricature, it brings out the dominant features of the subject:
“Undue multiplicity of personnel assigned either concurrently
or consecutively to a single function involves deterioration of
quality in the resultant product as compared with the product
of the labor of an exact sufficiency of personnel.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> One notices,
first of all, the leap into polysyllabic diction, along with the
total disappearance of those homely entities “cooks” and
“broth.” “Personnel,” for example, is an abstract dignifier, and
“resultant product” is safe, since it does not leave the writer on
record as affirming that the concoction in question actually is
broth. He is further protected by the expunging of “spoil,” with
its positive assertion, and he can hide behind the relativity of
“deterioration of quality ... as compared with....”</p>

<p>Such language, when used to express the phenomenology
of social and political behavior, gives a curious impression of
being foreign to its subject matter. The impression of foreignness
may be explained as follows. In all writing which has
come to be regarded as wisdom about the human being, there
is an undertone of the sardonic. Man at his best is a sort of
caricature of himself, and even when we are eulogizing him
for his finer attributes, there has to be a minor theme of depreciation,
much as a vein of comedy weaves in and out of a
great tragedy. The “great” actions of history appear either
sublime or ridiculous, depending on one’s standpoint, and it
may be the part of sagacity to regard them as both at the same
time. This note of the sardonic is found in biblical wisdom, in
Plato’s realism of situations, and even in Aristotle’s dry categorizing.
It appears in the <i>Federalist</i> papers,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> as the authors,
while debating political theory in high terms, kept a cagey
eye upon economic man. Man is neither an angel nor any kind
of disembodied spirit, and the attempt to treat him as such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
only arouses our sense of the ridiculous. The comic animal
must be there before we can grant that the representation is
“true.” The typical social science report, even when it discusses
situations in which baseness and irrationality figure
prominently, does not get in this ingredient. Every social fact
may be serious, but not every social action is serious because
action is not fully explainable without motive. It is this abstract
man which causes some of us to wonder about the predications
of an unhumanistic social science.</p>

<p>The remedy might be to employ, except where the necessity
of conceptualizing makes it difficult, something nearer the
language of the biblical parable (one shudders to think how
our bureaucrat would render “A sower went forth to sow”),
or the language of the best British journalism. I have often
felt that writers on social science might learn a valuable lesson
from the limpid prose of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. There one
usually finds statement without eulogistic or dyslogistic tendency,
adequacy without turgidity. It is perhaps the nearest
thing we have in practice to that supposititious reality, objective
language. There is some truth in the observation of John
Peale Bishop that, whereas American English is more vigorous,
English English is far more accurate. A good reportorial medium
will be, to a considerable extent, an English English,
and it will reflect something of the English genius for fact.</p>

<p>To sum up, the melioristic bias is a deflection toward language
which glosses over reality without necessarily giving
us a philosophic vocabulary. One could go so far as to say that
such language is comparatively lacking in responsibility. It is
the language that one expects from those who have become
insulated or daintified. It carries a slight suggestion of denial
of evil, which in lay circles, as in some ecclesiastical ones, is
among the greatest heresies. Perhaps the sociologist would
inspire more confidence as a social physician if his language
had more of the candor described above, and almost certainly
he would get a better understanding of his diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p><i>Do the social scientists lose more than they gain by a distrust
of metaphor?</i> Dr. Johnson once remarked of Swift, “The rogue
never hazards a metaphor,” and that may well be the reaction
of anyone who has plowed through the drab pages of a contemporary
sociologist. It has long been suspected that sociologists
and poets have little confidence in one another, and
here their respective procedures come into complete contrast.
The poet works mainly with metaphor, and the sociologist will
have none of it. Which is right? Or, if each is doing instinctively
the thing that is right for him, must we affirm that the works
they produce are of very unequal importance?</p>

<p>One can readily see how the social scientist might be guided
by the simple impression that, since metaphor characterizes
the language of poetry, it has, for that very reason, no place in
the language of science. Or, if he should become more analytical,
he might conclude that metaphor, through its very operation
of analogy or transference, implies the existence of a
realm which positivistic study denies. To use metaphor, then,
would be to pass over to the enemy. But he would be a very
limited kind of sociologist, a sort of doctrinaire mechanist,
not fully posted on all the resources open to scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>There are two more or less familiar theories of the nature of
metaphor. One holds that metaphor is mere decoration. It is
like the colored lights and gewgaws one hangs on a Christmas
tree; the tree is an integral tree without them, but they do add
sparkle and novelty and so are good things for such occasions.
So the metaphors used in language are pleasurable accessories,
which give it a certain charm and lift but which are supererogatory
when one comes down to the business of understanding
what is said. This theory has been fully discredited
not only by those who have analyzed the language of poetry,
but also by those who have gone furthest into the psychology
of language itself and have explored the “meaning of meaning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>A second theory holds that metaphor is a useful concession
to our feeble imagination. We are all children of Adam to the
extent that we crave material embodiments. Even the most
highly trained of us are wearied by long continuance of abstract
communication; we want the thing brought down to
earth so that we can see it. For the same reason that principles
have to be put into fables for children, the abstract conceptions
of modern science require figures for their popular expression.
Thus the universe of Einstein is represented as “like”
the surface of an orange; or the theory of entropy is illustrated
by the figure of a desert on which Arabs are riding their camels
hither and thither. From the standpoint of rhetoric, this theory
has some validity. Visualization is an aid to seeing relationships,
and there are rhetorical situations which demand some
kind of picturization. Many skilled expositors will follow an
abstract proposition with some easy figure which lets us down
to earth or enables us to get a bearing. There is some value,
then, in the “incarnation” of concepts. On this ground alone
one could defend the use of metaphors in communication.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>There is yet another theory, now receiving serious attention,
that metaphor is itself a means of discovery. Of course, metaphor
is intended here in the broadest sense, requiring only
some form of parallelism.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But when its essential nature is
understood, it is hard to resist the thought that metaphor is one
of the most important heuristic devices, leading us from a
known to an unknown, but subsequently verifiable, fact of
principle. Thus George de Santillana, writing on “Aspects of
Scientific Rationalism in the Nineteenth Century,” can declare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
“There is never a ‘strict induction’ but contains a considerable
amount of deduction, starting from points chosen
analogically.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In other words, analogy formulates and to
some extent directs the inquiry. Any investigation must start
from certain minimal likenesses, and that may conceal the
truth that some analogy lies at the heart of all assertion. Even
Bertrand Russell is compelled to accept analogy as one of the
postulates required to validate the scientific method because
it provides the antecedent probability necessary to justify an
induction.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>We might go so far as to admit the point of George Lundberg,
who has given attention to the underlying theory of
social science, that artists and philosophers make only “allegations”
about the world, which scientists must put to the test.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
For the inquiry may go from allegation to allegation, through
a series of metaphorical constructs. This in no wise diminishes
the role of metaphor but rather recognizes the role it has always
had. If we should speak, for example, of the “dance of
life,” we would be using a metaphor of considerable illuminating
power, in that it rests upon a number of resemblances,
some of which are hidden or profound. If we push it vigorously,
we may be surprised at some of the insights which will turn
up. Our naïve question, “What is it like?” which we ask of
anything we are confronting for the first time, is the intellect’s
cry for help. Unless it is like something in some measure, we
shall never get to understand it.</p>

<p>The usual student of literature is prone to feel that there is
more social psychology in <i>Hamlet</i> than in a dozen volumes on
the theory of the subject. Hamlet is a category, a kind of concrete
universal; why would he yield less as a factor in an
analysis than some operational definition? At least one social
psychologist has felt no hesitation about employing this kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of factor, the only difference being that his is Babbitt, of more
recent creation. Ellsworth Faris, in developing a thesis that
every person has several selves, presents his meaning as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Moreover, whatever the list of personalities or roles may be,
there is always room for one more, and indeed for many more.
When war comes, Babbitt will probably be a member of the committee
for public defense. He may become a member of a law
enforcement league yet to be formed. He may divorce his wife or
elope with his stenographer or misuse the mails and become a
Federal prisoner in Leavenworth. Each experience will mean a
new role with new personal attitudes and a new axiological conception
of himself.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is none the less illuminating because Babbitt is not the
product of a controlled scientific induction. He is a sort of
“alleged” symbol which works very well in a psychological
equation. Surely, it is enlightening to know that some men are
like Babbitt and others like Hamlet, or that we all have our
Babbitt and Hamlet phases. But here we should be primarily
interested in the fact that the Lynds’ <i>Middletown</i> (1929) followed
rather than preceded Lewis’s <i>Main Street</i> (1920). In
the best of literary and sociological worlds, <i>Main Street</i> directs
attention to Middletown, and <i>Middletown</i> reduces Main
Street to an operable entity.</p>

<p>The task of taking language away from poetry is a larger
operation than appears at first, and in the eyes of some students
an impossible one, even if it were desirable. We are all
like Emerson’s scholar in that the ordinary affairs of life come
to us business and go from us poetry—at least as soon as we
start expressing them in speech. Many words which we think
of as prosaic literalisms can be shown to have their origin in
long-forgotten comparisons. The word “depend” analogizes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the action of hanging from; “contact” analogizes a relationship.
“Discoverer” and “detect” stand for the literal operation
of taking off a covering, hence exposing to view. A “profound
study” apparently goes back to our perception of physical
depth. In this way the meaning which we attach to these
words is transferred from their analogues; and, of course, the
process is more obvious in language that is more consciously
metaphorical. It thus becomes plain that somewhere one has
to come to terms with metaphor anyhow, and there is a way
to turn the necessity into a victory.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p><i>Is the expression of social science affected by a caste spirit?</i>
The fact that social scientists are, in general, dedicated to the
removal of caste, or at least to a refutation of caste presumptions,
unfortunately does not prevent their becoming a caste.
Circumstances exist all the while to make them an <i>élite</i>. For
one thing, the scientific method of procedure sets them off
pretty severely from the average man, with his common-sense
approach to social problems. Not only is he likely to be nonplussed
by techniques and terminologies; he is also likely to
be repelled by what scientists consider one of their greatest
virtues—their detachment. Finally, it has to be admitted that
social scientists’ extensive patronage by universities, foundations,
and governments serves to give them a protected status
while they work. Every other group so situated has tended to
create a jargon, and thus far the social scientists have not been
an exception. Their jargon is a product partly of imitation and
partly of defense-mindedness.</p>

<p>Naturally one of the first steps in entering a profession is to
master the professional language. A display of familiarity with
the language is popularly taken as a sign of orthodoxy and
acceptance; and thus there arises a temptation to use the
special nomenclature freely even when one has doubts about
its aptness. This condition affects especially the young ones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
who are seeking recognition and establishment—the graduate
students and the instructors—in general, the probationers in
the field. Departure from orthodoxy can be interpreted as a
sign of ignorance or as a sign of independence, and, in the
case of those who have not passed probation, we usually interpret
it as the former. Accordingly, there is a degree of risk
involved in changing the pattern of speech laid down by one’s
colleagues. So the problem of what one has to do to show that
one belongs can be a problem of style. It is entirely possible
that many young social scientists do not write so well as they
could because of this inhibition. They are in the position of
having to satisfy teachers and critics, and they produce what is
expected or what they think is expected. In this way a natural
gift for the direct phrase and the lucid arrangement can be
swallowed up in tortuosities. The pattern can be broken only
by some gifted revolutionary or by someone invested with all
the honors of the guild.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, true, as Harold Laski has pointed out, that
every profession builds up a distrust of innovation, and especially
of innovation from the outside.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> It requires an unusual
degree of humility to see that the solution to our problem may
have to come from someone outside our number, perhaps from
some naïve person whose advantage is that he can see the
matter only in broad outline. Professions and bureaucracies
are on guard against this sort of person, and one of the barriers
they unconsciously set up is just this one of jargon. If certain
government policies were announced in the language of the
barbershop, their absurdity might become overwhelmingly
apparent. If certain projects in social science research (or in
language and literature research, for that matter) were explained
in the language of the daily news report, their futility
might become embarrassingly clear. One can only surmise
how an experienced political reporter would phrase the findings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
in Beyle’s <i>Identification and Analysis of Attribute-Cluster-Blocs</i>,
but one has a notion that his account would sound very
little like the original. Would it be unfair? The reply that
such language would destroy essential meanings in the original
would have to be weighed along with the alternative possibility
that the language was used in the first place because it
was euphemistic, in the sense we have outlined, or protective.
A user of such language may feel safe because the definition
of terms is, in a way, his possession. And so technical language,
as sometimes employed, may be Pickwickian, inasmuch as it
serves not just scientifically but also pragmatically. The average
citizen, faced with sociological explanations and bureaucratic
communiques, may feel as poor culprits used to feel
when confronted with law Latin.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The rhetorical obligation of the scientists has been aptly
expressed by T. Swann Harding in a discussion of the general
character of scientific writing. “Scientists,” he says, “gain
nothing by showing off, and the simpler they can make their
reports the better. Even their technical reports can be made
very much simpler without loss of accuracy or precision. Nor
is there really any valid substitute for a good working knowledge
of English composition and rhetoric.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The last statement
is true with certain qualifications, which ought to be
made explicit. In a final estimate of the problem it has to be
recognized that social science writing cannot be judged altogether
by literary standards. It is expression with a definite
assignment of duty; and those who have made a comparative
study of methods and styles know that every formula of expression
incurs its penalty. It is a rule in the realm of writing
that one pays for the choice one makes. The payment is exacted
when the form of expression becomes too exclusively what
it is. In course of use a defined style becomes its own enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
If one’s writing is abstract, it will accommodate ideas, but it
will fatigue the reader. If it is concrete, it will divert and relieve;
but it may become cloying, and it will have difficulty
in encompassing ideas. If it is spare, it will come to seem
abrupt; if it practices a degree of circumlocution, it will first
seem elegant but will come to seem inflated. The lucid style
is suspected of oversimplifying. And so the dilemma goes.</p>

<p>Now the social scientist has to write about a kind of thing,
and, notwithstanding his uncertain allocation of facts and concepts,
he may as well accept his penalty at the beginning. He
can never make it a primary goal to be “pleasing,” and for this
reason the purely literary performance is not for him. Dramatistic
presentation, a leading source of interest in all literary
production, is largely, if not entirely, out of his reach. The
only kind of writing that gets people emotionally involved contains
some form of dramatic conflict, which requires a dichotomy
of opposites. Yet the only dichotomy that social science
(as a science) contemplates is that of the norm and the deviate,
and these two are supposed to exist in an empirical rather
than in a moral context, and the injunction is implicit that all
we shall do is observe. The work, then, is going to be either
purely descriptive, or critical with reference to the norm-deviate
opposition. Not many people are going to develop a sense
of poignant concern over such presentations. To a certain extent
<i>Middletown</i> did catch the popular imagination, but the
contrast developed here was between what the American observably
was through the eyes of detached social scientists
and his picture of himself, with its compound of self-esteem,
aspiration, and social mythology. The community empirically
found was put on the stage to challenge the community sentimentally
and otherwise conceived. The same will hardly hold
for the typical case of scientific norm and empirically discovered
deviate, for no such ideas are involved in the contrast.
<i>Recent Social Trends in the United States</i>,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> for example, the
monumental report of President Hoover’s Research Committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
on Social Trends, could not look to this kind of interest
for its appeal. Unless, therefore, we regard metaphor as a
means of dramatistic presentation, this resource is not ordinarily
open to social science.</p>

<p>Yet within the purpose which the social scientist sets himself
there is a considerable range of rhetorical possibility,
which he ignores at needless expense. Rhetoric is, among other
things, a process of coordination and subordination which is
very close to the essential thought process. That is to say, in
any coherent piece of discourse there occur promotion and
demotion of thoughts, and this is accomplished not solely
through logical outlining and subsumation. It involves matters
of sequence, of quantity, and some understanding of the rhetorical
aspects of grammatical categories. These are means to
clear and effective expression, and the failure to see and use
them as means can produce a condition in which means and
ends seem not discriminated, or even a subversion in which
means seem to manipulate ends. That condition is one which
social science, along with every other instrumentality of education,
should be combating in the interest of a reasonable
world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_IX">Chapter IX<br />
ULTIMATE TERMS IN CONTEMPORARY RHETORIC</h2>

</div>

<p>We have shown that rhetorical force must be conceived
as a power transmitted through the links of
a chain that extends upward toward some ultimate
source. The higher links of that chain must always be of
unique interest to the student of rhetoric, pointing, as they
do, to some prime mover of human impulse. Here I propose to
turn away from general considerations and to make an empirical
study of the terms on these higher levels of force which
are seen to be operating in our age.</p>

<p>We shall define term simply here as a name capable of entering
into a proposition. In our treatment of rhetorical sources,
we have regarded the full predication consisting of a proposition
as the true validator. But a single term is an incipient
proposition, awaiting only the necessary coupling with another
term; and it cannot be denied that single names set up
expectancies of propositional embodiment. This causes everyone
to realize the critical nature of the process of naming.
Given the name “patriot,” for example, we might expect to see
coupled with it “Brutus,” or “Washington,” or “Parnell”; given
the term “hot,” we might expect to see “sun,” “stove,” and so
on. In sum, single terms have their potencies, this being part
of the phenomenon of names, and we shall here present a few
of the most noteworthy in our time, with some remarks upon
their etiology.</p>

<p>Naturally this survey will include the “bad” terms as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
as the “good” terms, since we are interested to record historically
those expressions to which the populace, in its actual
usage and response, appears to attribute the greatest sanction.
A prescriptive rhetoric may specify those terms which, in all
seasons, ought to carry the greatest potency, but since the
affections of one age are frequently a source of wonder to
another, the most we can do under the caption “contemporary
rhetoric” is to give a descriptive account and withhold the
moral until the end. For despite the variations of fashion, an
age which is not simply distraught manages to achieve some
system of relationship among the attractive and among the
repulsive terms, so that we can work out an order of weight
and precedence in the prevailing rhetoric once we have discerned
the “rhetorical absolutes”—the terms to which the very
highest respect is paid.</p>

<p>It is best to begin boldly by asking ourselves, what is the
“god term” of the present age? By “god term” we mean that
expression about which all other expressions are ranked as
subordinate and serving dominations and powers. Its force
imparts to the others their lesser degree of force, and fixes the
scale by which degrees of comparison are understood. In the
absence of a strong and evenly diffused religion, there may be
several terms competing for this primacy, so that the question
is not always capable of definite answer. Yet if one has to select
the one term which in our day carries the greatest blessing,
and—to apply a useful test—whose antonym carries the greatest
rebuke, one will not go far wrong in naming “progress.”
This seems to be the ultimate generator of force flowing down
through many links of ancillary terms. If one can “make it
stick,” it will validate almost anything. It would be difficult to
think of any type of person or of any institution which could
not be recommended to the public through the enhancing
power of this word. A politician is urged upon the voters as a
“progressive leader”; a community is proud to style itself
“progressive”; technologies and methodologies claim to the
“progressive”; a peculiar kind of emphasis in modern education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
calls itself “progressive,” and so on without limit. There
is no word whose power to move is more implicitly trusted
than “progressive.” But unlike some other words we shall
examine in the course of this chapter, its rise to supreme position
is not obscure, and it possesses some intelligible referents.</p>

<p>Before going into the story of its elevation, we must prepare
ground by noting that it is the nature of the conscious life of
man to revolve around some concept of value. So true is this
that when the concept is withdrawn, or when it is forced into
competition with another concept, the human being suffers
an almost intolerable sense of being lost. He has to know
where he is in the ideological cosmos in order to coordinate his
activities. Probably the greatest cruelty which can be inflicted
upon the psychic man is this deprivation of a sense of tendency.
Accordingly every age, including those of rudest cultivation,
sets up some kind of sign post. In highly cultivated
ages, with individuals of exceptional intellectual strength, this
may take the form of a metaphysic. But with the ordinary man,
even in such advanced ages, it is likely to be some idea abstracted
from religion or historical speculation, and made to
inhere in a few sensible and immediate examples.</p>

<p>Since the sixteenth century we have tended to accept as
inevitable an historical development that takes the form of a
changing relationship between ourselves and nature, in which
we pass increasingly into the role of master of nature. When
I say that this seems inevitable to us, I mean that it seems
something so close to what our more religious forebears considered
the working of providence that we regard as impiety
any disposition to challenge or even suspect it. By a transposition
of terms, “progress” becomes the salvation man is
placed on earth to work out; and just as there can be no
achievement more important than salvation, so there can be
no activity more justified in enlisting our sympathy and support
than “progress.” As our historical sketch would imply,
the term began to be used in the sixteenth century in the sense
of continuous development or improvement; it reached an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
apogee in the nineteenth century, amid noisy demonstrations
of man’s mastery of nature, and now in the twentieth century
it keeps its place as one of the least assailable of the “uncontested
terms,” despite critical doubts in certain philosophic
quarters. It is probably the only term which gives to the average
American or West European of today a concept of something
bigger than himself, which he is socially impelled to
accept and even to sacrifice for. This capacity to demand sacrifice
is probably the surest indicator of the “god term,” for when
a term is so sacrosanct that the material goods of this life must
be mysteriously rendered up for it, then we feel justified in
saying that it is in some sense ultimate. Today no one is
startled to hear of a man’s sacrificing health or wealth for the
“progress” of the community, whereas such sacrifices for other
ends may be regarded as self-indulgent or even treasonable.
And this is just because “progress” is the coordinator of all
socially respectable effort.</p>

<p>Perhaps these observations will help the speaker who would
speak against the stream of “progress,” or who, on the other
hand, would parry some blow aimed at him through the potency
of the word, to realize what a momentum he is opposing.</p>

<p>Another word of great rhetorical force which owes its origin
to the same historical transformation is “fact.” Today’s speaker
says “It is a fact” with all the gravity and air of finality with
which his less secular-minded ancestor would have said “It is
the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> “These are facts”; “Facts tend to show”; and “He
knows the facts” will be recognized as common locutions
drawing upon the rhetorical resource of this word. The word
“fact” went into the ascendent when our system of verification
changed during the Renaissance. Prior to that time, the
type of conclusion that men felt obligated to accept came
either through divine revelation, or through dialectic, which
obeys logical law. But these were displaced by the system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
verification through correspondence with physical reality.
Since then things have been true only when measurably true,
or when susceptible to some kind of quantification. Quite
simply, “fact” came to be the touchstone after the truth of
speculative inquiry had been replaced by the truth of empirical
investigation. Today when the average citizen says “It is
a fact” or says that he “knows the facts in the case,” he means
that he has the kind of knowledge to which all other knowledges
must defer. Possibly it should be pointed out that his
“facts” are frequently not facts at all in the etymological sense;
often they will be deductions several steps removed from
simply factual data. Yet the “facts” of his case carry with them
this aura of scientific irrefragability, and he will likely regard
any questioning of them as sophistry. In his vocabulary a fact
is a fact, and all evidence so denominated has the prestige of
science.</p>

<p>These last remarks will remind us at once of the strongly
rhetorical character of the word “science” itself. If there is
good reason for placing “progress” rather than “science” at the
top of our series, it is only that the former has more scope,
“science” being the methodological tool of “progress.” It
seems clear, moreover, that “science” owes its present status
to an hypostatization. The hypostatized term is one which
treats as a substance or a concrete reality that which has only
conceptual existence; and every reader will be able to supply
numberless illustrations of how “science” is used without any
specific referent. Any utterance beginning “Science says” provides
one: “Science says there is no difference in brain capacity
between the races”; “Science now knows the cause of
encephalitis”; “Science says that smoking does not harm the
throat.” Science is not, as here it would seem to be, a single
concrete entity speaking with one authoritative voice. Behind
these large abstractions (and this is not an argument against
abstractions as such) there are many scientists holding many
different theories and employing many different methods of
investigation. The whole force of the word nevertheless depends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
upon a bland assumption that all scientists meet periodically
in synod and there decide and publish what science
believes. Yet anyone with the slightest scientific training
knows that this is very far from a possibility. Let us consider
therefore the changed quality of the utterance when it is
amended to read “A majority of scientists say”; or “Many
scientists believe”; or “Some scientific experiments have indicated.”
The change will not do. There has to be a creature
called “science”; and its creation has as a matter of practice
been easy, because modern man has been conditioned to believe
that the powers and processes which have transformed
his material world represent a very sure form of knowledge,
and that there must be a way of identifying that knowledge.
Obviously the rhetorical aggrandizement of “science” here
parallels that of “fact,” the one representing generally and the
other specifically the whole subject matter of trustworthy
perception.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term “science” like “progress” seems to
satisfy a primal need. Man feels lost without a touchstone of
knowledge just as he feels lost without the direction-finder
provided by progress. It is curious to note that actually the
word is only another name for knowledge (L. <i>scientia</i>), so
that if we should go by strict etymology, we should insist that
the expression “science knows” (<i>i.e.</i>, “knowledge knows”) is
pure tautology. But our rhetoric seems to get around this by
implying that science is <i>the</i> knowledge. Other knowledges
may contain elements of quackery, and may reflect the selfish
aims of the knower; but “science,” once we have given the
word its incorporation, is the undiluted essence of knowledge.
The word as it comes to us then is a little pathetic in its appeal,
inasmuch as it reflects the deeply human feeling that somewhere
somehow there must be people who know things “as
they are.” Once God or his ministry was the depository of such
knowledge, but now, with the general decay of religious
faith, it is the scientists who must speak <i>ex cathedra</i>, whether
they wish to or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>The term “modern” shares in the rhetorical forces of the
others thus far discussed, and stands not far below the top.
Its place in the general ordering is intelligible through the
same history. Where progress is real, there is a natural presumption
that the latest will be the best. Hence it is generally
thought that to describe anything as “modern” is to credit it
with all the improvements which have been made up to now.
Then by a transference the term is applied to realms where
valuation is, or ought to be, of a different source. In consequence,
we have “modern living” urged upon us as an ideal;
“the modern mind” is mentioned as something superior to
previous minds; sometimes the modifier stands alone as an
epithet of approval: “to become modern” or “to sound modern”
are expressions that carry valuation. It is of course idle not to
expect an age to feel that some of its ways and habits of mind
are the best; but the extensive transformations of the past
hundred years seem to have given “modern” a much more
decisive meaning. It is as if a difference of degree had changed
into a difference of kind. But the very fact that a word is not
used very analytically may increase its rhetorical potency, as
we shall see later in connection with a special group of terms.</p>

<p>Another word definitely high up in the hierarchy we have
outlined is “efficient.” It seems to have acquired its force
through a kind of no-nonsense connotation. If a thing is efficient,
it is a good adaptation of means to ends, with small loss
through friction. Thus as a word expressing a good understanding
and management of cause and effect, it may have a
fairly definite referent; but when it is lifted above this and
made to serve as a term of general endorsement, we have to
be on our guard against the stratagems of evil rhetoric. When
we find, to cite a familiar example, the phrase “efficiency apartments”
used to give an attractive aspect to inadequate dwellings,
we may suspect the motive behind such juxtaposition.
In many similar cases, “efficient,” which is a term above reproach
in engineering and physics, is made to hold our attention
where ethical and aesthetic considerations are entitled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
to priority. Certain notorious forms of government and certain
brutal forms of warfare are undeniably efficient; but here the
featuring of efficiency unfairly narrows the question.</p>

<p>Another term which might seem to have a different provenance
but which participates in the impulse we have been
studying is “American.” One must first recognize the element
of national egotism which makes this a word of approval with
us, but there are reasons for saying that the force of “American”
is much more broadly based than this. “This is the American
way” or “It is the American thing to do” are expressions
whose intent will not seem at all curious to the average American.
Now the peculiar effect that is intended here comes from
the circumstance that “American” and “progressive” have an
area of synonymity. The Western World has long stood as a
symbol for the future; and accordingly there has been a very
wide tendency in this country, and also I believe among many
people in Europe, to identify that which is American with
that which is destined to be. And this is much the same as
identifying it with the achievements of “progress.” The typical
American is quite fatuous in this regard: to him America is
the goal toward which all creation moves; and he judges a
country’s civilization by its resemblance to the American
model. The matter of changing nationalities brings out this
point very well. For a citizen of a European country to become
a citizen of the United States is considered natural and
right, and I have known those so transferring their nationality
to be congratulated upon their good sense and their anticipated
good fortune. On the contrary, when an American takes
out British citizenship (French or German would be worse),
this transference is felt to be a little scandalous. It is regarded
as somehow perverse, or as going against the stream of things.
Even some of our intellectuals grow uneasy over the action
of Henry James and T. S. Eliot, and the masses cannot comprehend
it at all. Their adoption of British citizenship is not mere
defection from a country; it is treason to history. If Americans
wish to become Europeans, what has happened to the hope of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the world? is, I imagine, the question at the back of their
minds. The tremendous spread of American fashions in behavior
and entertainment must add something to the impetus,
but I believe the original source to be this prior idea that
America, typifying “progress,” is what the remainder of the
world is trying to be like.</p>

<p>It follows naturally that in the popular consciousness of
this country, “un-American” is the ultimate in negation. An
anecdote will serve to illustrate this. Several years ago a leading
cigarette manufacturer in this country had reason to believe
that very damaging reports were being circulated about
his product. The reports were such that had they not been
stopped, the sale of this brand of cigarettes might have been
reduced. The company thereupon inaugurated an extensive
advertising campaign, the object of which was to halt these
rumors in the most effective way possible. The concocters of
the advertising copy evidently concluded after due deliberation
that the strongest term of condemnation which could be
conceived was “un-American,” for this was the term employed
in the campaign. Soon the newspapers were filled with advertising
rebuking this “un-American” type of depreciation
which had injured their sales. From examples such as this we
may infer that “American” stands not only for what is forward
in history, but also for what is ethically superior, or at least
for a standard of fairness not matched by other nations.</p>

<p>And as long as the popular mind carries this impression, it
will be futile to protest against such titles as “The Committee
on un-American activities.” While “American” and “un-American”
continue to stand for these polar distinctions, the average
citizen is not going to find much wrong with a group set up to
investigate what is “un-American” and therefore reprehensible.
At the same time, however, it would strike him as most
droll if the British were to set up a “Committee on un-British
Activities” or the French a “Committee on un-French Activities.”
The American, like other nationals, is not apt to be much
better than he has been taught, and he has been taught systematically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
that his country is a special creation. That is why
some of his ultimate terms seem to the general view provincial,
and why he may be moved to polarities which represent only
local poles.</p>

<p>If we look within the area covered by “American,” however,
we find significant changes in the position of terms which
are reflections of cultural and ideological changes. Among the
once powerful but now waning terms are those expressive of
the pioneer ideal of ruggedness and self-sufficiency. In the
space of fifty years or less we have seen the phrase “two-fisted
American” pass from the category of highly effective images
to that of comic anachronisms. Generally, whoever talks the
older language of strenuosity is regarded as a reactionary, it
being assumed by social democrats that a socially organized
world is one in which cooperation removes the necessity for
struggle. Even the rhetorical trump cards of the 1920’s, which
Sinclair Lewis treated with such satire, are comparatively impotent
today, as the new social consciousness causes terms of
centrally planned living to move toward the head of the series.</p>

<p>Other terms not necessarily connected with the American
story have passed a zenith of influence and are in decline; of
these perhaps the once effective “history” is the most interesting
example. It is still to be met in such expressions as “History
proves” and “History teaches”; yet one feels that it has lost the
force it possessed in the previous century. Then it was easy for
Byron—“the orator in poetry”—to write, “History with all her
volumes vast has but one page”; or for the commemorative
speaker to deduce profound lessons from history. But people
today seem not to find history so eloquent. A likely explanation
is that history, taken as whole, is conceptual rather than factual,
and therefore a skepticism has developed as to what it
teaches. Moreover, since the teachings of history are principally
moral, ethical, or religious, they must encounter today
that threshold resentment of anything which savors of the
prescriptive. Since “history” is inseparable from judgment of
historical fact, there has to be a considerable community of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
mind before history can be allowed to have a voice. Did the
overthrow of Napoleon represent “progress” in history or the
reverse? I should say that the most common rhetorical uses of
“history” at the present are by intellectuals, whose personal
philosophy can provide it with some kind of definition, and by
journalists, who seem to use it unreflectively. For the contemporary
masses it is substantially true that “history is bunk.”</p>

<p>An instructive example of how a coveted term can be monopolized
may be seen in “allies.” Three times within the
memory of those still young, “allies” (often capitalized) has
been used to distinguish those fighting on our side from the
enemy. During the First World War it was a supreme term;
during the Second World War it was again used with effect;
and at the time of the present writing it is being used to designate
that nondescript combination fighting in the name of the
United Nations in Korea. The curious fact about the use of
this term is that in each case the enemy also has been constituted
of “allies.” In the First World War Germany, Austria-Hungary,
and Turkey were “allies”; in the Second, Germany
and Italy; and in the present conflict the North Koreans and
the Chinese and perhaps the Russians are “allies.” But in the
rhetorical situation it is not possible to refer to them as “allies,”
since we reserve that term for the alliance representing our
side. The reason for such restriction is that when men or nations
are “allied,” it is implied that they are united on some
sound principle or for some good cause. Lying at the source
of this feeling is the principle discussed by Plato, that friendship
can exist only among the good, since good is an integrating
force and evil a disintegrating one. We do not, for example,
refer to a band of thieves as “the allies” because that term
would impute laudable motives. By confining the term to our
side we make an evaluation in our favor. We thus style ourselves
the group joined for purposes of good. If we should
allow it to be felt for a moment that the opposed combination
is also made up of allies, we should concede that they are
united by a principle, which in war is never done. So as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
usage goes, we are always allies in war and the enemy is just
the enemy, regardless of how many nations he has been able to
confederate. Here is clearly another instance of how tendencies
may exist in even the most innocent-seeming language.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to the terms of repulsion. Some terms of repulsion
are also ultimate in the sense of standing at the end of
the series, and no survey of the vocabulary can ignore these
prime repellants. The counterpart of the “god term” is the
“devil term,” and it has already been suggested that with us
“un-American” comes nearest to filling that role. Sometimes,
however, currents of politics and popular feeling cause something
more specific to be placed in that position. There seems
indeed to be some obscure psychic law which compels every
nation to have in its national imagination an enemy. Perhaps
this is but a version of the tribal need for a scapegoat, or for
something which will personify “the adversary.” If a nation
did not have an enemy, an enemy would have to be invented
to take care of those expressions of scorn and hatred to which
peoples must give vent. When another political state is not
available to receive the discharge of such emotions, then a
class will be chosen, or a race, or a type, or a political faction,
and this will be held up to a practically standardized form of
repudiation. Perhaps the truth is that we need the enemy in
order to define ourselves, but I will not here venture further
into psychological complexities. In this type of study it will be
enough to recall that during the first half century of our nation’s
existence, “Tory” was such a devil term. In the period
following our Civil War, “rebel” took its place in the Northern
section and “Yankee” in the Southern, although in the previous
epoch both of these had been terms of esteem. Most readers
will remember that during the First World War “pro-German”
was a term of destructive force. During the Second World
War “Nazi” and “Fascist” carried about equal power to condemn,
and then, following the breach with Russia, “Communist”
displaced them both. Now “Communist” is beyond any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
rival the devil term, and as such it is employed even by the
American president when he feels the need of a strong rhetorical
point.</p>

<p>A singular truth about these terms is that, unlike several
which were examined in our favorable list, they defy any real
analysis. That is to say, one cannot explain how they generate
their peculiar force of repudiation. One only recognizes them
as publicly-agreed-upon devil terms. It is the same with all.
“Tory” persists in use, though it has long lost any connection
with redcoats and British domination. Analysis of “rebel” and
“Yankee” only turns up embarrassing contradictions of position.
Similarly we have all seen “Nazi” and “Fascist” used
without rational perception; and we see this now, in even
greater degree, with “Communist.” However one might like to
reject such usage as mere ignorance, to do so would only evade
a very important problem. Most likely these are instances of
the “charismatic term,” which will be discussed in detail presently.</p>

<p>No student of contemporary usage can be unmindful of the
curious reprobative force which has been acquired by the
term “prejudice.” Etymologically it signifies nothing more
than a prejudgment, or a judgment before all the facts are in;
and since all of us have to proceed to a great extent on judgments
of that kind, the word should not be any more exciting
than “hypothesis.” But in its rhetorical applications “prejudice”
presumes far beyond that. It is used, as a matter of fact,
to characterize unfavorably any value judgment whatever. If
“blue” is said to be a better color than “red,” that is prejudice.
If people of outstanding cultural achievement are praised
through contrast with another people, that is prejudice. If one
mode of life is presented as superior to another, that is prejudice.
And behind all is the implication, if not the declaration,
that it is un-American to be prejudiced.</p>

<p>I suspect that what the users of this term are attempting,
whether consciously or not, is to sneak “prejudiced” forward
as an uncontested term, and in this way to disarm the opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
by making all positional judgments reprehensible. It must
be observed in passing that no people are so prejudiced in the
sense of being committed to valuations as those who are engaged
in castigating others for prejudice. What they expect is
that they can nullify the prejudices of those who oppose them,
and then get their own installed in the guise of the <i>sensus communis</i>.
Mark Twain’s statement, “I know that I am prejudiced
in this matter, but I would be ashamed of myself if I weren’t”
is a therapeutic insight into the process; but it will take more
than a witticism to make headway against the repulsive force
gathered behind “prejudice.”</p>

<p>If the rhetorical use of the term has any rational content,
this probably comes through a chain of deductions from the
nature of democracy; and we know that in controversies centered
about the meaning of democracy, the air is usually filled
with cries of “prejudice.” If democracy is taken crudely to
mean equality, as it very frequently is, it is then a contradiction
of democracy to assign inferiority and superiority on whatever
grounds. But since the whole process of evaluation is a
process of such assignment, the various inequalities which are
left when it has done its work are contradictions of this root
notion and hence are “prejudice”—the assumption of course
being that when all the facts are in, these inequalities will be
found illusory. The man who dislikes a certain class or race or
style has merely not taken pains to learn that it is just as good
as any other. If all inequality is deception, then superiorities
must be accounted the products of immature judgment. This
affords plausible ground, as we have suggested, for the coupling
of “prejudice” and “ignorance.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the ordered series of good and
bad terms, one feels obliged to say something about the way
in which hierarchies can be inverted. Under the impulse of
strong frustration there is a natural tendency to institute a
pretense that the best is the worst and the worst is the best—an
inversion sometimes encountered in literature and in social
deportment. The best illustration for purpose of study here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
comes from a department of speech which I shall call “GI
rhetoric.” The average American youth, put into uniform,
translated to a new and usually barren environment, and imbued
from many sources with a mission of killing, has undergone
a pretty severe dislocation. All of this runs counter to the
benevolent platitudes on which he was brought up, and there
is little ground for wonder if he adopts the inverted pose. This
is made doubly likely by the facts that he is at a passionate age
and that he is thrust into an atmosphere of superinduced excitement.
It would be unnatural for him not to acquire a rhetoric
of strong impulse and of contumacious tendency.</p>

<p>What he does is to make an almost complete inversion. In
this special world of his he recoils from those terms used by
politicians and other civilians and by the “top brass” when
they are enunciating public sentiments. Dropping the conventional
terms of attraction, this uprooted and specially focussed
young man puts in their place terms of repulsion. To be more
specific, where the others use terms reflecting love, hope, and
charity, he uses almost exclusively terms connected with the
excretory and reproductive functions. Such terms comprise
what Kenneth Burke has ingeniously called “the imagery of
killing.” By an apparently universal psychological law, faeces
and the act of defecation are linked with the idea of killing, of
destruction, of total repudiation—perhaps the word “elimination”
would comprise the whole body of notions. The reproductive
act is associated especially with the idea of aggressive
exploitation. Consequently when the GI feels that he must
give his speech a proper show of spirit, he places the symbols
for these things in places which would normally be filled by
prestige terms from the “regular” list. For specimens of such
language presented in literature, the reader is referred to the
fiction of Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been compelled to listen to such rhetoric
will recall the monotony of the vocabulary and the vehemence
of the delivery. From these two characteristics we may infer
a great need and a narrow means of satisfaction, together with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
the tension which must result from maintaining so arduous an
inversion. Whereas previously the aim had been to love (in
the broad sense) it is now to kill; whereas it had been freedom
and individuality, it is now restriction and brutalization. In
taking revenge for a change which so contradicts his upbringing
he is quite capable, as the evidence has already proved, of
defiantly placing the lower level above the higher. Sometimes
a clever GI will invent combinations and will effect metaphorical
departures, but the ordinary ones are limited to a reiteration
of the stock terms—to a reiteration, with emphasis of
intonation, upon “the imagery of killing.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Taken as a whole,
this rhetoric is a clear if limited example of how the machine
may be put in reverse—of how, consequently, a sort of devil
worship may get into language.</p>

<p>A similar inversion of hierarchy is to be seen in the world of
competitive sports, although to a lesser extent. The great
majority of us in the Western world have been brought up
under the influence, direct or indirect, of Christianity, which
is a religion of extreme altruism. Its terms of value all derive
from a law of self-effacement and of consideration for others,
and these terms tend to appear whenever we try to rationalize
or vindicate our conduct. But in the world of competitive
sports, the direction is opposite: there one is applauded for
egotistic display and for success at the expense of others—should
one mention in particular American professional baseball?
Thus the terms with which an athlete is commended will
generally point away from the direction of Christian passivity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
although when an athlete’s character is described for the
benefit of the general public, some way is usually found to
place him in the other ethos, as by calling attention to his
natural kindness, his interest in children, or his readiness to
share his money.</p>

<p>Certainly many of the contradictions of our conduct may be
explained through the presence of these small inverted hierarchies.
When, to cite one further familiar example, the acquisitive,
hard-driving local capitalist is made the chief lay
official of a Christian church, one knows that in a definite area
there has been a transvaluation of values.</p>

<p>Earlier in the chapter we referred to terms of considerable
potency whose referents it is virtually impossible to discover
or to construct through imagination. I shall approach this
group by calling them “charismatic terms.” It is the nature of
the charismatic term to have a power which is not derived,
but which is in some mysterious way given. By this I mean to
say that we cannot explain their compulsiveness through referents
of objectively known character and tendency. We normally
“understand” a rhetorical term’s appeal through its connection
with something we apprehend, even when we object
morally to the source of the impulse. Now “progress” is an
understandable term in this sense, since it rests upon certain
observable if not always commendable aspects of our world.
Likewise the referential support of “fact” needs no demonstrating.
These derive their force from a reading of palpable
circumstance. But in charismatic terms we are confronted
with a different creation: these terms seem to have broken
loose somehow and to operate independently of referential
connections (although in some instances an earlier history of
referential connection may be made out). Their meaning
seems inexplicable unless we accept the hypothesis that their
content proceeds out of a popular will that they <i>shall</i> mean
something. In effect, they are rhetorical by common consent,
or by “charisma.” As is the case with charismatic authority,
where the populace gives the leader a power which can by no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
means be explained through his personal attributes, and permits
him to use it effectively and even arrogantly, the charismatic
term is given its load of impulsion without reference,
and it functions by convention. The number of such terms is
small in any one period, but they are perhaps the most efficacious
terms of all.</p>

<p>Such rhetorical sensibility as I have leads me to believe that
one of the principal charismatic terms of our age is “freedom.”
The greatest sacrifices that contemporary man is called upon
to make are demanded in the name of “freedom”; yet the referent
which the average man attaches to this word is most
obscure. Burke’s dictum that “freedom inheres in something
sensible” has not prevented its breaking loose from all anchorages.
And the evident truth that the average man, given a
choice between exemption from responsibility and responsibility,
will choose the latter, makes no impression against its
power. The fact, moreover, that the most extensive use of the
term is made by modern politicians and statesmen in an effort
to get men to assume more responsibility (in the form of military
service, increased taxes, abridgement of rights, etc.)
seems to carry no weight either.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The fact that what the
American pioneer considered freedom has become wholly impossible
to the modern apartment-dwelling metropolitan
seems not to have damaged its potency. Unless we accept
some philosophical interpretation, such as the proposition that
freedom consists only in the discharge of responsibility, there
seems no possibility of a correlation between the use of the
word and circumstantial reality. Yet “freedom” remains an
ultimate term, for which people are asked to yield up their
first-born.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that “democracy” is becoming
the same kind of term. The variety of things it is used to
symbolize is too weird and too contradictory for one to find
even a core meaning in present-day usages. More important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
than this for us is the fact, noted by George Orwell, that people
resist any attempt to define democracy, as if to connect it with
a clear and fixed referent were to vitiate it. It may well be that
such resistance to definition of democracy arises from a subconscious
fear that a term defined in the usual manner has its
charisma taken away. The situation then is that “democracy”
means “be democratic,” and that means exhibit a certain attitude
which you can learn by imitating your fellows.</p>

<p>If rationality is measured by correlations and by analyzable
content, then these terms are irrational; and there is one further
modern development in the creation of such terms which
is strongly suggestive of irrational impulse. This is the increasing
tendency to employ in the place of the term itself an
abbreviated or telescoped form—which form is nearly always
used with even more reckless assumption of authority. I seldom
read the abbreviation “U S” in the newspapers without
wincing at the complete arrogance of its rhetorical tone. Daily
we see “U S Cracks Down on Communists”; “U S Gives OK to
Atomic Weapons”; “U S Shocked by Death of Official.” Who
or what is this “U S”? It is clear that “U S” does not suggest a
union of forty-eight states having republican forms of government
and held together by a constitution of expressly delimited
authority. It suggests rather an abstract force out of a
new world of forces, whose will is law and whom the individual
citizen has no way to placate. Consider the individual
citizen confronted by “U S” or “FBI.” As long as terms stand
for identifiable organs of government, the citizen feels that he
knows the world he moves around in, but when the forces of
government are referred to by these bloodless abstractions,
he cannot avoid feeling that they are one thing and he another.
Let us note while dealing with this subject the enormous proliferation
of such forms during the past twenty years or so. If
“U S” is the most powerful and prepossessing of the group, it
drags behind it in train the previously mentioned “FBI,” and
“NPA,” “ERP,” “FDIC,” “WPA,” “HOLC,” and “OSS,” to
take a few at random. It is a fact of ominous significance that
this use of foreshortened forms is preferred by totalitarians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
both the professed and the disguised. Americans were hearing
the terms “OGPU,” “AMTORG” and “NEP” before their own
government turned to large-scale state planning. Since then
we have spawned them ourselves, and, it is to be feared, out
of similar impulse. George Orwell, one of the truest humanists
of our age, has described the phenomenon thus: “Even in the
early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and
phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political
language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use
abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian
countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such
words as Nazi, Gestapo, Comintern, Inprecor, Agitprop.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>I venture to suggest that what this whole trend indicates is
an attempt by the government, as distinguished from the
people, to confer charismatic authority. In the earlier specimens
of charismatic terms we were examining, we beheld
something like the creation of a spontaneous general will. But
these later ones of truncated form are handed down from
above, and their potency is by fiat of whatever group is administering
in the name of democracy. Actually the process is
no more anomalous than the issuing of pamphlets to soldiers
telling them whom they shall hate and whom they shall like
(or try to like), but the whole business of switching impulse
on and off from a central headquarters has very much the
meaning of <i>Gleichschaltung</i> as that word has been interpreted
for me by a native German. Yet it is a disturbing fact that such
process should increase in times of peace, because the persistent
use of such abbreviations can only mean a serious divorce
between rhetorical impulse and rational thought. When
the ultimate terms become a series of bare abstractions, the
understanding of power is supplanted by a worship of power,
and in our condition this can mean only state worship.</p>

<p>It is easy to see, however, that a group determined upon
control will have as one of its first objectives the appropriation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of sources of charismatic authority. Probably the surest way
to detect the fabricated charismatic term is to identify those
terms ordinarily of limited power which are being moved up
to the front line. That is to say, we may suspect the act of
fabrication when terms of secondary or even tertiary rhetorical
rank are pushed forward by unnatural pressure into ultimate
positions. This process can nearly always be observed
in times of crisis. During the last war, for example, “defense”
and “war effort” were certainly regarded as culminative terms.
We may say this because almost no one thinks of these terms
as the natural sanctions of his mode of life. He may think thus
of “progress” or “happiness” or even “freedom”; but “defense”
and “war effort” are ultimate sanctions only when measured
against an emergency situation. When the United States was
preparing for entry into that conflict, every departure from our
normal way of life could be justified as a “defense” measure.
Plants making bombs to be dropped on other continents were
called “defense” plants. Correspondingly, once the conflict
had been entered, everything that was done in military or
civilian areas was judged by its contribution to the “war effort.”
This last became for a period of years the supreme term: not
God or Heaven or happiness, but successful effort in the war.
It was a term to end all other terms or a rhetoric to silence all
other rhetoric. No one was able to make his claim heard
against “the war effort.”</p>

<p>It is most important to realize, therefore, that under the
stress of feeling or preoccupation, quite secondary terms can
be moved up to the position of ultimate terms, where they will
remain until reflection is allowed to resume sway. There are
many signs to show that the term “aggressor” is now undergoing
such manipulation. Despite the fact that almost no term
is more difficult to correlate with objective phenomena, it is
being rapidly promoted to ultimate “bad” term. The likelihood
is that “aggressor” will soon become a depository for all the
resentments and fears which naturally arise in a people. As
such, it will function as did “infidel” in the mediaeval period
and as “reactionary” has functioned in the recent past. Manifestly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
it is of great advantage to a nation bent upon organizing
its power to be able to stigmatize some neighbor as “aggressor,”
so that the term’s capacity for irrational assumption is a
great temptation for those who are not moral in their use of
rhetoric. This passage from natural or popular to state-engendered
charisma produces one of the most dangerous lesions of
modern society.</p>

<p>An ethics of rhetoric requires that ultimate terms be ultimate
in some rational sense. The only way to achieve that
objective is through an ordering of our own minds and our
own passions. Every one of psychological sophistication knows
that there is a pleasure in willed perversity, and the setting up
of perverse shibboleths is a fairly common source of that
pleasure. War cries, school slogans, coterie passwords, and all
similar expressions are examples of such creation. There may
be areas of play in which these are nothing more than a diversion;
but there are other areas in which such expressions lure
us down the roads of hatred and tragedy. That is the tendency
of all words of false or “engineered” charisma. They often
sound like the very gospel of one’s society, but in fact they
betray us; they get us to do what the adversary of the human
being wants us to do. It is worth considering whether the real
civil disobedience must not begin with our language.</p>

<p>Lastly, the student of rhetoric must realize that in the contemporary
world he is confronted not only by evil practitioners,
but also, and probably to an unprecedented degree, by
men who are conditioned by the evil created by others. The
machinery of propagation and inculcation is today so immense
that no one avoids entirely the assimilation and use of
some terms which have a downward tendency. It is especially
easy to pick up a tone without realizing its trend. Perhaps the
best that any of us can do is to hold a dialectic with himself
to see what the wider circumferences of his terms of persuasion
are. This process will not only improve the consistency
of one’s thinking but it will also, if the foregoing analysis is
sound, prevent his becoming a creature of evil public forces
and a victim of his own thoughtless rhetoric.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Without rhetoric there seems no possibility of tragedy, and in
turn, without the sense of tragedy, no possibility of taking an elevated
view of life. The role of tragedy is to keep the human lot from being
rendered as history. The cultivation of tragedy and a deep interest in
the value-conferring power of language always occur together. The
<i>Phaedrus</i>, the <i>Gorgias</i>, and the <i>Cratylus</i>, not to mention the works of
many teachers of rhetoric, appear at the close of the great age of Greek
tragedy. The Elizabethan age teemed with treatises on the use of language.
The essentially tragic Christian view of life begins the long tradition
of homiletics. Tragedy and the practice of rhetoric seem to find
common sustenance in preoccupation with value, and then rhetoric
follows as an analyzed art.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Cf. Maritain, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 3-4: “The truth of practical intellect is
understood not as conformity to an extramental being but as conformity
to a right desire; the end is no longer to know what is, but to bring into
existence that which is not yet; further, the act of moral choice is so individualized,
both by the singularity of the person from which it proceeds
and the context of the contingent circumstances in which it takes place,
that the practical judgment in which it is expressed and by which I
declare to myself: this is what I must do, can be right only if, <i>hic et nunc</i>,
the dynamism of my will is right, and tends towards the true goods of
human life.</p>

<p>That is why practical wisdom, <i>prudentia</i>, is a virtue indivisibly moral
and intellectual at the same time, and why, like the judgment of the
conscience itself, it cannot be replaced by any sort of theoretical knowledge
or science.”</p>

needed, one could not do better than cite his sentence from the <i>Reflections</i>
depicting the “circumstance” of Bourbon France (<i>Works</i>, II, 402).
“Indeed, when I consider the face of the kingdom of France; the multitude
and opulence of her cities; the useful magnificence of her spacious
high roads and bridges; the opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations
opening the conveniences of maritime communication through a
continent of so immense an extent; when I turn my eyes to the stupendous
works of her ports and harbours, and to her whole naval apparatus,
whether for war or trade; when I bring before my view the number of
her fortifications, constructed with so bold and masterly skill, and made
and maintained at so prodigious a charge, presenting an armed front
and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every side; when I recollect
how very small a part of that extensive region is without cultivation,
and to what complete perfection the culture of many of the best productions
of the earth have been brought in France; when I reflect on the
excellence of her manufactures and fabrics, second to none but ours, and
in some particulars not second; when I contemplate the grand foundations
of charity, public and private; when I survey the state of all the
arts that beautify and polish life; when I reckon the men she has bred
for extending her fame in war, her able statesmen, the multitude of her
profound lawyers and theologians, her philosophers, her critics, her
historians and antiquaries, her poets and her orators, sacred and profane:
I behold in all this something which awes and commands the imagination,
which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and undiscriminate
censure, and which demands that we should very seriously examine,
what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us at once
to level so spacious a fabric with the ground.”</p>

that his titles of the naturalistic period are with one exception nouns, all
those of the transitional period are prepositions actually or in quality

<p><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> Some correlation appears to exist between the mentality of an era
and the average length of sentence in use. The seventeenth century, the
most introspective, philosophical, and “revolutionary” era of English
history, wrote the longest sentence in English literature. The next era,
broadly recognized as the eighteenth century, swung in the opposite
direction, with a shorter and much more modelled or contrived sentence.
The nineteenth century, again turned a little solemn and introspective,
wrote a somewhat long and loose one. Now comes the twentieth century,
with its journalism and its syncopated tempo, to write the shortest sentence
of all.</p>

<i>Journal of General Education</i>, IV (January, 1950), 149. Although it is
not our concern here, it probably could be shown that the essential requirements
of oratory themselves depend upon a certain organization of
society, such as an aristocratic republicanism. When Burke declares that
a true natural aristocracy “is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions,
which, taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths”
(<i>Works</i> [London, 1853-64], III, 85-86) my impression is that he has
in mind something resembling our “uncontested term.” The “legitimate
presumptions” are the settled things which afford the plane of maneuver.</p>
